# Open Legend SRD

## The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll ##

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in *Open Legend* will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action’s Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.

| THE ACTION ROLL |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :-- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> - OR - <br /> *the player fails but the story progresses*. (GM’s Choice) |

# Character Creation

## Step 1: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can’t do--the spheres he excels in, as well as his greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and supernatural.

A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Supernatural attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.

In *Open Legend*, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

  If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| ATTRIBUTE QUICK BUILDS |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don’t have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div class="table-no-body table-centered"></div>
| PURCHASING ATTRIBUTES |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Dice |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |

## Step 2: Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with a breath of flame, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, or sturdiness. For example, foes attempting to poison you, push you off a cliff, or crush you with an iron maul will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Evasion = 10 + Agility |
| - |
| |

**Evasion** protects you from attacks that test your quickness and ability to dodge. Your enemies would need to overcome your evasion in order to hit you with a fireball, shoot you with an arrow, or stab you with a rapier.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character’s ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to supernaturally charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

## Step 3: Purchase Feats

While your character’s attributes define his skill at accomplishing
heroic tasks, his **feats** are what make him unique among other
characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him
the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so he takes the *Combat Momentum* feat to allow him to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred berserker, takes *Berserker* so that she
can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate her foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat
points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

## Step 4: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of *Open Legend*, your character will start with the gear he needs for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.

## Step 5: Describe Your Character

*Open Legend *is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than attributes, feats, and gear. To make your character come to life, add the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if he has any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in the next step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing the aforementioned psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the scent perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the observant perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the hot tempered flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits. **Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign. Here are a few examples of character secrets to give you some ideas:

*Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.*

*Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.*

*Talia was raised as a Druid of the Briar Rose, but she fled the Order out of distaste for their violent ways. Now, she fears the reprisal of her ex-brethren at every turn.*

## Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws
In addition to the descriptive details you have just created, you may also choose up to two perks and up to two flaws from the following lists.

Perks are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.

Flaws are your Achilles’ heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won’t accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you’re blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.


### Activating Perks

Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the *profession* perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their *profession: hunter* perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC’s experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.

### Activating Flaws

While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in the future.

You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the *disabled* flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that he is usually completely unaffected by his blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder him.

To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.

The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It’s also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.

### Gaining Perks and Flaws

At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the *profession: sailor* perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the *physical deformity* flaw to describe your scarred face.

You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM’s approval as your character’s personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the *cowardly* flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the *artisan* perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws.

### Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws

The lists provided here are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.

Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.

Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the *artisan* perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the *attractive* perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the *idol* perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.

### Perk List

#### Arcane Bloodline

Your ancestry can be traced to dragons, fey, or a similarly magical race. As such, you command the respect of those who practice the arcane arts.  You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the ways of magic, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.

#### Artisan

Choose a specific craft, such as weapon smithing, glass blowing, or brewing. You know the ins and outs of crafting goods of the highest quality within your chosen specialty. As a master craftsman, you are able to create items of exceptional value given the necessary time and materials. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your crafting skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Ascetic

You are well-versed in the art of living with less. Whether a cloistered monk or a wizened sage who spent years locked away in a tower of books, you are experienced at going long stretches of time with very little food, water, or company - and as such, these situations tend not to affect you as they do others. You are hardened against physical and mental deprivation and have developed an enviable degree of self-mastery.

#### Attractive

You are just really darn good looking. This plays to your favor more than just romantically, and your good looks tend to help you out in all sorts of social situations. Whenever your attractiveness would play a role in a situation, you gain advantage 1 to any relevant action rolls.

#### Brute

While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear.  Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your *Might* attribute for a *Persuasion* roll.  If your *Persuasion* score is already equal to or greater than your *Might* score, you get advantage 1 on the roll.

#### Courageous

Your heart is brave beyond bounds. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel all negative effects upon you related to fear or low morale.

#### Crowd Favorite

Whether you are an actor, musician, storyteller, magician, or some other type of performer, the common folk love your work. They adore you for your ability to use your art to transport them to a world beyond their daily drudgery, and you can always find a place to perform and make money at the local tavern or inn.


#### Divine Agent

You serve a higher being and have earned their protection. Once per game session, when you are subject to a *Finishing Blow* while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.

#### Divine Insight

You possess a supernatural connection to a deity, demi-god, or other divine being which grants you otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story.  The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful.  If you’ve just failed a *Learning* attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.

#### Ear of the Emperor

You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.

#### Idol

Your reputation for some outstanding virtue precedes you, and people tend to hold you in high esteem. Once per session, you can call upon your reputation to inspire trust from someone who is skeptical of you, your actions, or your allies.

#### Innocent

Whether from a distant fey ancestry or simply an air of naivety, you possess a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts.  Once per game session, you can leverage your innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.

#### Jack of All Trades

You have a knack for picking up new skills.  Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided its Challenge Rating is less than or equal to 14.

#### Local Hero

You are well-known and respected as a protector of the common folk in a small region. The commoners look up to you, and will offer you food, shelter, and other necessities. They will even take risks or assume minor costs to aid or protect you, so long as the risk is not death.

#### Lucky

Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck shine to upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.

#### Merchant

You know the art of economics as well as the best of businessmen. A master of supply and demand, you have a knack for knowing when to buy and when to sell. You cannot be swindled when it comes to bartering, and you always know whether or not you are getting a fair price. Furthermore, you have friends in merchant circles and guilds in your home city, and you can easily gain them in new locations.

#### Noble

Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts.  You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them.  In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.

#### Observant

Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss.  Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary.  For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing.  If you use this ability after failing a *Perception* roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.

#### Outlaw

You are part of a criminal network, whether it be a thieves’ guild, band of smugglers, or otherwise. Once per game session, you can call in a favor from a contact within your network to perform a mundane task such as gathering information or arranging safe passage. If the favor puts your contact at risk, they will still perform it but may ask for an equally risky favor from you in return.

#### Profession

Choose a specific trade, such as sailor, soldier, or miner. You know everything there is to know about the business and are a master of the requisite skills. A sailor, for example, can tie a knot for all occasions, navigate by the stars, and man any station aboard a ship. A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.

#### Pure-hearted

Any goodly-natured creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral.  Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.

#### Resilient

Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a Fortitude action roll of Challenge Rating less than or equal to 10 + twice your Fortitude score.

#### Scavenger

You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sun-baked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.

#### Scent

Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast.  As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’. Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 on attempts to track a creature if it has left a scent trail.

#### Scholar

You have spent years studying a particular discipline, such as science, herbalism, dragon lore, history, politics, or religion. Once per session, you can re-roll a failed *Learning* check related to your discipline, gaining advantage 2 on the re-roll. Furthermore, you have colleagues and connections within your discipline, and know the proper channels for gaining access to specialty laboratories, libraries, temples, or other collections of lore related to your field of scholarship.

#### Silver Tongue

You have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.

#### Stone Sense

While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered. Furthermore, you have advantage 1 on any action rolls in which a familiarity with underground environments would prove helpful, such as attempts to identify the risk of a cave in or to find a secret passage within a cavern.

#### Street Rat

You were raised on the streets or at least spent a good deal of time crawling about them. As such, you know how to navigate urban areas quickly, make yourself unseen, and find a bite to eat when you’re down on your luck. As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets.

#### Sylvan Ally

Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your reputation for defending nature.

#### Vagabond

Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild. You always know the direction of true north and you can automatically find enough food to feed yourself plus a number of additional people equal to your Learning attribute score.

#### Warrior’s Code

As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes.  Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.

#### Whisperer of the Wild

Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot.  The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.

### Flaw List

#### Absent-minded

Your live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.

#### Addiction

The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you’ve got an itch that you need to scratch, and you’ll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.

#### Ambitious

You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it’s typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.

#### Bloodlust

Battle isn’t just a way of life, it is *the* way of life. There isn’t a conflict you’ve encountered that wasn’t best solved with steel, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren’t necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.


#### Brash

You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a peck of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.

#### Bravado

You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.

#### Cosmetic Deformity

Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.

#### Compulsion

You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.

#### Cowardly

You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harms way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.

#### Dimwitted

You aren’t the sharpest tack in the box. It’s not just that you weren’t gifted with skill in academia, it’s that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.

#### Disabled

You have some physical deficiency that holds you back in life. You decide the nature and severity of your disability. Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.

#### Greedy

You can’t help it: you just like things. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you’ll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You’re easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.

#### Honest

You won’t tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.

#### Hot Tempered
Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive. Sometimes your anger boils slowly over time and other times it erupts completely unexpectedly. But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.

#### Illiterate

You can’t read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.

#### Literal Minded

You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerated by saying “I’d kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend’s life if Melzak did get elected.

#### Mood Disorder

You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety. You get to to determine the nature and severity of your mood disorder.

#### Naive

Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you’re a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.

#### Overt

You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.

#### Overweight

You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.

#### Pacifist

You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won’t lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.

#### Phobia

You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence, a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.

#### Proud

Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you’re not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Space Marines leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.

#### Psychotic

You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality. You get to determine the extent and nature of your psychosis, including any potential triggers. For example, you might believe that beings from another dimension are trying to abduct you, or perhaps you relive a nightmarish scene from your past whenever you are in the midst of a gun fight.

#### Short-winded

You have poor lung capacity and easily tire. Sprints, long runs, and forced marches are either impossible for you or they tend to leave you completely incapacitated afterwards.

#### Sick

You suffer from some sort of chronic illness or condition, such as tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis, or irritable bowel syndrome. Even if you possess the means to treat your disease or control the symptoms, you might still have episodes or flare ups that hinder your adventuring life.

#### Socially Awkward

Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don’t respect the personal space of others, you tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.

#### Stubborn
It’s your way or the highway. Maybe not all of the time, but once you’ve made your mind up on an important matter, you won’t budge. You probably won’t even compromise.

#### Uncoordinated

Your body just doesn’t work well with itself. You have trouble balancing, catching, throwing, and performing similar physical tasks that require dexterity or nimbleness.

#### Vengeful

You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out.

#### Zealous

You stand for a cause - whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise - and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause.

## Gaining XP and Leveling Up

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.

Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters, NPCs, and monsters. Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Player Character Level Advancement |
| - |
| |

<br>

| Total XP | Level | Maximum Attribute Score |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 5 |
| 9 | 4 | 5 |
| 12 | 5 | 5 |
| 15 | 6 | 6 |
| 18 | 7 | 7 |
| 21 | 8 | 8 |
| 24 | 9 | 9 |
| 27 | 10 | 9 |

### Feat and Attribute Points

For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points *every* time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.

Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.

See [*Feats*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats) to view the complete list of feats to choose from.

### New Hit Points

In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.

# Actions and Attributes

## When to Roll the Dice

*Open Legend *is about creating great stories full of epic moments of heroism, and you roll dice to determine the outcome of those moments. In short, you only need to make action rolls when the outcome of the intended action plays a significant role in the story. In combat, for
example, you’ll be making plenty of action rolls to clash blades, sling spells, and leap over treacherous chasms. But you don’t need to roll a Persuasion check every time you go to buy something from the bazaar, and you don’t need to roll Logic to remember where you left the key to your room at the inn.

## Every Roll Matters

Another important point in *Open Legend* is that every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by a successful roll from another character.

If you look back to the Core Mechanic, you can see that a simple failure is not an option:

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| The Action Roll  |
| - |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

<br />

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> **- OR -** <br /> the player fails, but the story progresses. <br />*(GM’s Choice)* |

### Keep It Simple: Every Roll Matters for the GM

The “every roll matters” rule was designed to make player actions meaningful to the story whether they succeed or fail. It recognizes the fact that static pass/fail checks aren’t particularly fun for players. But “every roll matters” also adds an extra layer of complexity to the game because it requires the GM to make on-the-fly interpretations.

**So when the GM makes a roll**, a success is a success and a failure is a failure.

This is for the sake of simplicity and fun. When a player fails a roll, it’s not very fun if something doesn’t come out of it. When the GM fails a roll, though, there is usually much rejoicing at the table.

## Determining Challenge Rating

Many actions that you will undertake in *Open Legend* have a Challenge Rating (CR) that is determined by the rules. Attacks in combat, for example, use one of the target’s defense scores as the CR.

Oftentimes, though, the GM will need to determine the CR for actions that aren’t spelled out clearly in the rules. In these cases, the GM can use the Challenge Ratings by Difficulty Table to set an appropriate CR.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Challenge Ratings by Difficulty |
| - |
| |

| Difficulty | Challenge Rating | Example Actions |
| :-: | :-: | :------ |
| Everyday | 10 | leap a 5’ gap, climb a surface with ledges, break down a household door, haggle a simple merchant for a discount |
| Challenging | 15 | climb a rough surface, catch the drift of a text in an unfamiliar language, break down a strong wooden door |
| Very Hard | 20 | climb a smooth surface, leap a 15’ gap, translate a text in an unfamiliar language, convince a neutral party to take a risk for you |
| Heroic | 25 | translate a text in an alien language, break down an iron door |
| Legendary | 30 | leap a 25’ chasm, climb a flat surface, befriend an enemy with a vendetta against you |

It’s important to note that Challenge Ratings are not typically set to be relative to the party’s level. So, breaking down a strong wooden door is CR 15 whether the party is first level or tenth.

### Contested Actions

Sometimes, two or more characters are directly opposing each other in a test of strength, wits, or charm. For example, a mighty barbarian wrestles with a minotaur to get hold of a magical gem. Or three representatives of different kingdoms attempt to persuade the outlander chieftain to join their forces. Or a stealthy rogue attempts to sneak unseen past the watch of the town guard. These sorts of situations are called **contested actions**.

To resolve such contests, each character involved makes an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Whoever rolls the highest succeeds at the action. Sometimes, all parties use the same attribute for their action rolls, but often, each character will use a different attribute, as in the case of the rogue attempting to sneak (Agility) past the guard’s watch (Perception).

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes, you will attempt an action under circumstances that give you a significant upper hand, such as when attacking an enemy from behind. Other times, you’ll be working against exceptional hindrances, such as when trying to climb a rope that an enemy has covered in grease. In these types of cases, instead of adjusting the Challenge Rating of the task, the GM should assign your roll either **advantage** or **disadvantage**.

Advantage and disadvantage are always expressed with a numeric level, such as “advantage 1” or “disadvantage 3”. Multiple instances of advantage and disadvantage can add together, so if you have advantage 1 on an attack because you are flanking a foe, and you also possess a feat that grants you advantage 1, you have a total of advantage 2.

If a situation arises in which you are assigned both advantage and disadvantage, find the difference between the two values to determine your final outcome. For example, if you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 1, they negate each other and thus your action roll is normal. If you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 2, your action roll would be made with disadvantage 1.

### Effects of Advantage and Disadvantage

When you have advantage on an action, roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your advantage level. Then, when adding your dice together, ignore the lowest *X* attribute dice, in which *X* is your advantage level.

### Assigning Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage can be assigned by the GM due to situational effects, or they can be assigned by feats, banes, and boons. When assigned situationally, the GM should never apply more than one level of advantage or disadvantage. Feats, banes, and boons--on the other hand--will often provide multiple levels as they rise in tier or power level. The Advantage and Disadvantage Examples Tables provides a listing of typical situations in which the GM may assign advantage and disadvantage, though this list is by no means exhaustive.
