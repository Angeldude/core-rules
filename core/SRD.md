# Open Legend SRD

## The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll ##

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in *Open Legend* will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action’s Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.
