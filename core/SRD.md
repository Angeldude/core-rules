# Open Legend SRD

## The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll ##

Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in *Open Legend* will be determined by the roll of dice.

To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character's attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.

Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action’s Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.

| THE ACTION ROLL |
| :-: |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |

| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :-- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> - OR - <br /> *the player fails but the story progresses*. (GM’s Choice) |

# Character Creation

## Step 1: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in *Open Legend*. They define what your character can and can’t do--the spheres he excels in, as well as his greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In *Open Legend*, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and supernatural.

A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Supernatural attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.

In *Open Legend*, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

  If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| ATTRIBUTE QUICK BUILDS |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don’t have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div class="table-no-body table-centered"></div>
| PURCHASING ATTRIBUTES |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You’ll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Dice |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |

## Step 2: Calculate Defenses and Hit Points

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with a breath of flame, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, or sturdiness. For example, foes attempting to poison you, push you off a cliff, or crush you with an iron maul will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Evasion = 10 + Agility |
| - |
| |

**Evasion** protects you from attacks that test your quickness and ability to dodge. Your enemies would need to overcome your evasion in order to hit you with a fireball, shoot you with an arrow, or stab you with a rapier.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character’s ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to supernaturally charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

## Step 3: Purchase Feats

While your character’s attributes define his skill at accomplishing
heroic tasks, his **feats** are what make him unique among other
characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him
the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so he takes the *Combat Momentum* feat to allow him to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred berserker, takes *Berserker* so that she
can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate her foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat
points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

## Step 4: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of *Open Legend*, your character will start with the gear he needs for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.

## Step 5: Describe Your Character

*Open Legend *is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than attributes, feats, and gear. To make your character come to life, add the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if he has any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in the next step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing the aforementioned psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the scent perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the observant perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the hot tempered flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits. **Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign. Here are a few examples of character secrets to give you some ideas:

*Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.*

*Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.*

*Talia was raised as a Druid of the Briar Rose, but she fled the Order out of distaste for their violent ways. Now, she fears the reprisal of her ex-brethren at every turn.*
