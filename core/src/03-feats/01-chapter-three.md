# Chapter 4: Feats

In this chapter, you'll find complete descriptions of all of the feats available to customize your character in Open Legend. Feats are used to define your character's specializations--the actions, tasks, and abilities they excel at beyond all others. Some feats will enhance your major actions, such as by allowing you to multi-attack with reduced disadvantage, while others will grant you completely new powers, such as the ability to change your shape.

## Acquiring Feats

During your adventurers, the GM will award you Experience Points (or XP) for accomplishing quests and driving the story forward. Every time you gain a point of XP, you also gain one feat point that can be used to purchase new feats just as you did during character creation. You do not have to spend these feat points when you gain them. You can feel free to save any unused feat points to be used at a later time.

## Reading a Feat Description

Each feat description includes the following elements.

**Title.** The name of the feat. Some feats contain multiple tiers, rising in power with each new tier. If a feat contains multiple tiers, these will be indicated in parentheses after the title (e.g., “Alternate Form (I - II)”).

**Cost.** This is the number of feat points required to purchase the feat. If the feat has multiple tiers, the cost is the same for each tier and must be paid every time the feat is purchased at a new tier *unless otherwise noted in the feat description*. So, to access the Tier 5 ability of a feat, you must pay for the feat 5 times. If a feat does not have a noted exception it can only be purchased once.

**Prerequisites.** Many feats have specific requirements that must be met before a character can purchase the feat. Prerequisites may take the form of a minimum attribute score, another feat, or a special requirement. If a feat has multiple tiers with different prerequisites, the requirements for each tier are separated by a slash.

**Description.** This entry simply provides a general idea of what the feat could look like in the story. Because feats generally provide mechanical benefits that aren't tied to specific sources, you can interpret the look and feel of your feat in a way that best fits your character concept and campaign setting. For example, a paladin in a typical fantasy setting might use the *companion* feat to enlist the assistance of a noble squire, while a technologist in a futuristic campaign might use the same feat to create an automaton combat droid. In both cases, the feat functions the same even though it is described differently.

**Effect.** This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the feat on the rules of the game.

## Feat List


### Alternate Form (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:** 3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 2:** None
- **Description:** You have the ability to transform from one persona to another, whether that be through bodily transformation like a werewolf or through exterior mechanisms, such as a cybernetically enhanced soldier who can call forth a symbiotic mech suit.
- **Effect:** Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat:
 
 - **Tier 1** - Half of your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.
 - **Tier 2** - Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points less than your primary form.

 Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.

 As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.
 
 Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.
 
 In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead.
- **Special:** When selecting feats for your alternate form, you may not select the _Alternate Form_ feat.
 
 With GM approval, you may take this feat multiple times. If you do, you get access to an additional form. Multiple Alternate Forms can be a powerful way of accumulating new feat points and attributes. The GM should prevent players from exploiting the feat to create an overly powerful character.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4: FEATS</div>


### Area Manipulation (I - V)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 5:** None
- **Description:** Whether unloading your assault rifle on full-automatic or hurling a ball of flame, you are exceptionally precise at choosing targets for area attacks, allowing you to avoid allies who would otherwise be caught in the line of fire.
- **Effect:** For each tier of this feat you possess, you can omit a single 5-foot square from being targeted as part of an area attack.

### Armor Mastery (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 2:** None
- **Description:** Whether you are a heavily armored mechanized knight or a nimble rogue in studded leather, you and your armor are one. Your training and experience at wearing armor allows you to maximize its protection and minimize its drawbacks.
- **Effect:** Your training allows you to sleep in armor without gaining one level of the _fatigued_ bane. In addition, while wearing armor, you gain the following benefits:

 - **Tier 1** - The Fortitude prerequisite for wearing armor is reduced by 1. When wearing armor, you get a +1 armor bonus to your Guard defense.
 - **Tier 2** - The Fortitude prerequisite for wearing armor is reduced by 2. When wearing armor, you get a +2 armor bonus to your Guard defense. Any movement penalty is reduced by 5 feet.

### Attack Redirection

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Defensive Reflexes II
- **Description:** You are adept at redirecting your enemy's attacks. Whether using fancy footwork, magical force, or tactical superiority, you know how to force your enemy to attack unintended targets.
- **Effect:** When you make a defend action and your roll exceeds the attacker's action roll, you can choose to redirect the attack to a target that is neither you, nor the attacker. The original attack roll does not change, only the target. If the attack was a melee attack, you can redirect it to anyone within 5' of you (as opposed to within 5' of the attacker).


### Attack Specialization (I - IX)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 3:** Agility 3, Might 3, or Any Extraordinary 3
 - **Tier 4 - 6:** Agility 5, Might 5, or Any Extraordinary 5
 - **Tier 7 - 9:** Agility 7, Might 7, or Any Extraordinary 7
- **Description:** Like a samurai who masters the art of the katana or an elementalist who specializes in summoning flame, you are so well trained with a particular form of attack that you can devastate foes with much more skill than the average combatant.
- **Effect:** When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type. You gain advantage 1 per tier of this feat for any _damaging_ attack made with your chosen attack type. This bonus does not apply to bane attacks or boon invocations.
 Examples of attack types you can choose to specialize in include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, creation, and force - though this list is not exhaustive.
- **Special:** In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new weapon or attack type each time. Your total advantage to an attack is equal to your tier for that particular weapon or attack type. For example, a character might have Attack Specialization II (Fire) for fire attacks and Attack Specialization IV (Long Sword) for long sword attacks.

### Attribute Substitution (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 2:** None
- **Description:** Your prowess in an extraordinary, mental, or social attribute is linked in a way that empowers another attribute of your character, allowing you to use that attribute for tasks normally reserved for another. Examples of Attribute Substitution in play include a martial artist who is physically weak but capable of using internal chi to throw and disable opponents, an anatomical genius who uses logic to make vital strikes rather than their agility, or a gunslinger whose deadshot aim is the result of a dark pact.
- **Effect:** When you take this feat, you create a permanent link between two attributes: one stronger (the primary attribute) and one weaker (the dependent attribute). You may use your primary attribute in place of the dependent attribute for different purposes depending on which tier of the feat you have:
 - **Tier 1**
   ___
   - Making non-attack, non-invocation action rolls
   - Calculating hit points, defenses, and other secondary statistics
   - Meeting feat prerequisites
   - Other situations at the GM's discretion
 - **Tier 2**
   ___
   - Making attack action rolls
   - Invoking banes and boons

 The relationship formed by your two attributes is subject to case-by-case approval and must be approved by the GM first. The link must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. For example, a brawler who substitutes their Logic for their Might to represent their ability to use leverage in grappling rather than strength would likely not get to use their Logic score for an attempt to bend the bars on a prison cell.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4: FEATS</div>


Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include a calculating warrior who studies angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility.
___


### Bane Focus

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Ability to invoke the chosen bane
- **Description:** You are specialized in the use of a particular bane that is iconic to your character. Perhaps you are a martial artist known for your stunning strikes, a sniper who knows how to slow a target's escape, or a fire mage who sets enemies ablaze with persistent burning damage.
- **Effect:** Choose a bane that you can invoke. When your roll on a damaging attack exceeds the target's defense by 5 or more (as opposed to the usual 10), you can inflict this bane for free. Each attack is still only capable of inflicting a single bane. Furthermore, when making a bane attack to inflict your chosen bane, you gain advantage 2 on the bane attack roll.

**Special:** You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a different bane.

### Battle Trance

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Fortitude 3 or Will 3
- **Description:** You can enter a heightened mental state of combat readiness, in which your body is strengthened and your mind transcends fear and pain. Examples include a raging barbarian or an unstoppable samurai with laser focus in the heat of battle.
- **Effect:** As a free action on your turn, you may enter a battle trance. While entranced, you have advantage 1 on all attacks. Additionally, your Toughness and Resolve defenses are increased by 3. If your total armor bonus is less than 3, it becomes 3. If you take three consecutive turns without making an attack roll against an enemy creature, the battle trance ends. When the battle trance ends, you automatically suffer 1 level of the _fatigued_ bane.

### Battlefield Opportunist (I - V)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 5:** Agility 4 or Might 4
- **Description:** Your battlefield prowess allows you to capitalize on windows of opportunity that others don't notice, making you far more deadly in melee combat. Whether you wield an axe, plasmablade, or your bare fists, foes struggle to maneuver around or away from you.
- **Effect:** You may make an additional opportunity attack per round for each tier of this feat you possess. You can only make one opportunity attack per triggering action (e.g., you cannot make multiple attacks against the same foe when they leave your threatened space).

### Battlefield Punisher

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:**
  - Agility 5, Might 5, or any Extraordinary 5
  - Battlefield Reflexes
- **Description:** Not only are your battle reflexes uncanny, but you can devastate your opponents with a signature secondary effect. Examples of this feat in action include a stalwart paladin who knocks foes prone, a ninja who blinds enemies, or a telekinetic psychic who hurls attacks away.
- **Effect:** Choose a bane you can inflict. Any time you use the defend action with an attribute that could inflict the chosen bane and deal 10 damage via the Battlefield Reflexes feat, you may choose to automatically afflict the attacker with the chosen bane.

### Battlefield Reflexes

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Agility 4, Might 4, or any Extraordinary 4
- **Description:** You are a master of the counter attack. This might take the form of deftly redirecting a strike back upon the attacker or simply capitalizing on holes in your foe's guard when they are in the midst of an attack. Your prowess on the battlefield allows you to not only intercept attacks but also decimate foes with your retaliatory strikes.
- **Effect:** When you use the defend interrupt action, you also deal damage to the attacker equal to the amount by which your action roll exceeds the attacker's roll.

### Boon Access

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** You have a special gift: it might be the result of your heritage, a close encounter with magical energy, or the result of years of training with a master. In any case, although you do not necessarily possess the aptitude to work extraordinary powers for yourself or create a desired effect with your physical capabilities alone, you are able to reliably replicate a single boon.
- **Effect:** When you choose this feat, choose one boon that you do not have the requisite attribute to invoke. The cost of this feat is equal to the power level of the chosen boon. You can invoke the chosen boon despite lacking the necessary attribute. For invocation rolls, treat your attribute score as the power level of the boon. If the boons has multiple attribute prerequisite options, you choose one attribute when you take this feat. Additionally, 


\page 

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4: FEATS</div>

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___

- 
- 
- you count as having access to the chosen boon for the purpose of meeting feat prerequisites, and your attribute for meeting such prerequisites is equal to the power level of the boon. The Boon Access feat bypasses the normal attribute score restrictions based on character level, so a first level character could spend all 6 of their feat points to begin play with access to a power level 6 boon.
 You may acquire this feat multiple times. Each time, select a new boon.
- **Special:** You may take this feat multiple times. Each time you do, choose a new boon to gain access to.

 Note that this feat can give access to high-powered boons with a potential for very dramatic impact on the storyline of a game. As such, using this feat to access a boon of power level 6 or higher should be approved by the GM before using it in a game.

 If you ever meet the attribute prerequisite for the chosen boon, you may choose at that time to lose this feat and regain the feat points spent. Re-allocate them as you choose.

### Boon Focus (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 3:** Ability to invoke the chosen boon
- **Description:** You are specialized in the use a particular boon that is iconic to your character. Examples of this feat in action include a druid who can shapechange at-will, a combat medic who can tend the wounds of many with expert skill, and a mad scientist who can animate mechanical minions effortlessly.
- **Effect:** Choose a single boon that you can invoke. You can benefits with that boon according to your tier in this feat.
 - **Tier 1** - When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.
 - **Tier 2** - You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour. If the invocation time for a boon is 1 minor action, it can be invoked only once as a minor action. Beyond that it can be invoked by expending a move or major action.
 - **Tier 3** - The effect at tier 3 varies based on the duration of the boon:


<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- 
- 
- 
 - 
   - **If the chosen boon has a duration of "sustain persists"**, you gain advantage 4 on your action roll to  invoke if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, one instance of the boon can be sustained each round as a free action, rather than a minor action. If the boon is somehow temporarily cancelled, in the absence of other rules, you can invoke it again as a free action. If targeted by the _nullify_ bane, this effect can only be canceled by a power level 6 or greater invocation of that bane.
   - **If the boon has a different duration**, you gain advantage 5 on your action roll to invoke if you are not single-targeting.
- **Special:** In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new boon each time. Your tier of this feat is independent for each boon.

### Breakfall (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 2:** Agility 4
- **Description:** You are as graceful as a swan. Like the martial artists and swashbucklers of legendary tales, your agility enables you to fall from deadly heights unharmed.
- **Effect:**
- **Tier 1** - As long as you are conscious and able to act, reduce all falling damage by half.
- **Tier 2** - As long as you are conscious and able to act, you do not suffer falling damage.


### Brutal Intimidation

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Might 2
- **Description:** Your powers of persuasion stem from application of brute force rather than your social grace. When you smash a table, brandish your blade, or flex your muscles, people stop what they are doing and listen to you.
- **Effect:** If you're able to make a show of physical force, you can use your Might attribute in place of Persuasion for the action roll.

### Climbing

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** You gain the ability to climb or parkour perfectly, akin to certain vampires, aberrant creatures, ninjas, and insects.

<div class="wide" style="height: 2400px;"></div>


### Combat Follow-Through

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:** 2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** You are able to decimate many enemies in quick succession. Like a legendary Samurai warrior or matchless elven archer, your foes fall in waves before you.
- **Effect:** Every time you bring an enemy to zero hit points with a Might or Agility attack, you can immediately make an extra attack as a free action.

### Combat Momentum

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** Whether through brute strength or lightning reflexes, you are able to use the momentum of combat to maneuver around the battlefield with ease.
- **Effect:** Every time you bring an enemy to zero hit points with a Might or Agility attack, you can immediately move up to your normal speed as a free action.
- **Special:** If you have the Movement attribute, you can use the Teleport boon instead of a normal move.




### Companion (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 3:** None
- **Description:** Whether a hired bodyguard, a loyal animal sidekick, or a sibling that follows you everywhere, you have the constant and unflinching loyalty of one particular companion character.
- **Effect:** You gain a companion character that acts independently from you. During combat, your companion acts on its own initiative count and gains the usual assortment of actions, which you may choose. You also get to assign your companion's attributes. Whenever you gain a level or purchase a new tier in this feat, you may reassign your companion's attributes and feats.

\page

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 4: FEATS</div>

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- 
- 
- 
 - **Tier 1** - Your companion has a total of 20 attribute points plus 4 per level of your character.
 - **Tier 2** - Your companion receives 3 feat points.
 - **Tier 3** - Your companion has a total of 30 attribute points plus 6 per level of your character. In addition, you can optionally grant feats to your companion. In order to do so, you spend your own feat points and the companion receives the feat instead of you. The companion, not you, must meet all feat prerequisites. Any math related to these feats are calculated based on the companion's attributes, feats, etc. If you have spent feat points this way and would gain feat points from any other effect, those feat points are reduced by the number of feat points you have granted to your companion.
- **Special:** If you ever lose your companion, voluntarily or involuntarily, you regain the feat points that you have spent on this feat and any of the companion's feats, and may spend them as usual.

 In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new companion each time.

### Craft Mundane Item (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 2:** Learning 3, Logic 3, or Knowledge I
- **Description:** You have mastered a particular craft, and given proper time and materials, you can create items related to that craft. You might be an expert blacksmith, professional engineer, master alchemist, or any similar manner of professional craftsman.
- **Effect:** Choose a specific craft or profession. You can create items that are relevant to your chosen craft, and your GM will determine the speed at which you craft based on the nature of the item and the materials you have access to. Your tier in the Craft Mundane Item feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can craft. Unlike acquiring items by using your wealth (described in Chapter 5), crafting does not limit your ability to acquire additional goods.
 - **Tier 1** - Craft items equal to your wealth level.
 - **Tier 2** - Craft items equal to your wealth level + 1.
 
 **Craft Examples** (This list is not exhaustive, you can work with your GM to come up with new crafts).
 ___
 - Alchemy - acid, chemicals, non-magical tinctures, incense, reagents
 - Arcane - magical ingredients, inks, scrolls, exotic components
 - Blacksmithing - metal, leather, weapons, armor, wheels, horseshoes
 - Chemistry - acid, explosives, narcotics
 - Engineering - machines, wheels, gears, guns, vehicles
 - Geography - maps, cartography, instruments of navigation
 - Herbalism - poultices, natural remedies, stimulants, brewing 
 - Medicine - medical tools, tonics, tinctures, pain relievers, anti-toxins
- **Special:** In addition to taking multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new craft or profession each time.

### Craft Extraordinary Item (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 3:** Learning 5, Logic 5, or any Extraordinary 5
- **Description:** You are studied in the ways of imbuing magical items, building futuristic technology, brewing potions, or crafting extraordinary devices. Their power is permanent but varies depending on your skill.
- **Effect:** Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by the GM), you can create extraordinary items (as detailed in Chapter 9: Special Equipment). You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with Energy 5, you must possess an Energy score of 5 or higher. The only exception to this is if you possess the Creation, Learning, or Logic attributes. These allow you to imbue items with any attribute, bane, or boon as long as their value is less than or equal to your attribute score. The GM may rule that certain uses of Creation, Learning, or Logic are unreasonable for crafting extraordinary items.

 Your tier in this feat determines the maximum wealth level of the items you can create, based on the attribute you are using to craft:

 - **Tier 1** - Maximum wealth level is attribute  minus 2.
 - **Tier 2** - Maximum wealth level is attribute minus 1.
 - **Tier 3** - Maximum wealth level is attribute.

 For example, a character with Creation 5 and tier 1 in this feat could create items up to wealth level 3.
 
 You can determine the wealth level of the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in **Chapter 9: Special Equipment** or by developing a custom item using the rules for **Building Your Own Extraordinary Items** in that chapter.
 
 Creating an item with the _consumable_ property requires one full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of uninterrupted work based on their wealth level, as follows:

 - **Wealth Level 1 - 3**: Two days per wealth level
 - **Wealth Level 4 - 5**: Four days per wealth level
 - **Wealth Level 6 - 7**: One week per wealth level
 - **Wealth Level 8 - 9**: One month per wealth level

 At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient wealth score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in **Chapter 5: Wealth & Equipment**. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Fire Resistance, the GM may decide that the dragon’s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor’s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.

### Crushing Blow

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:**
  - Might 6
  - Overpowering Strike
- **Description:** Like a reckless ogre wading through combat, your relentless blows not only knock your opponents back, but also knock them off their feet completely.
- **Effect:** Any time that you deal damage to an enemy, in addition to pushing them 5 feet (if you choose) from the Overpowering Strike feat, you can also knock them down in the space where the forced move ends; the target suffers the effects of the _knockdown_ bane.

### Death Blow (I - II)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:**
   - Agility 6
   - Lethal Strike I
 - **Tier 2:**
   - Agility 7
   - Lethal Strike III
- **Description:** You are able to quickly finish off enemies that are near death and silence them before they cry out. This attack is one that is commonly seen used by rogues, assassins, and snipers who can silently eliminate weaker enemies without being detected.
- **Effect:**
 - **Tier 1** - If you damage an enemy with a Lethal Strike and their total HP is 5 or less after the attack, then you can choose to reduce them to zero HP instead. In addition, you can choose to silence any enemy reduced to zero hit points by an attack from you.
 - **Tier 2** - Your death blow HP threshold increases from 5 to 10. In addition, on a successful Lethal Strike, the _stunned_ bane is automatically inflicted without counting against your usual 1 bane per attack limit.

### Deathless Trance

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:**
  - Fortitude 7
  - Battle Trance
- **Description:** Whether you are a berserker of the icy north, a hulking superhero of unstoppable might, or a cybernetically enhanced soldier, your battle fury is legendary. You possess the rare ability to fight on long after your body should have given up.
- **Effect:** While in a battle trance you cannot be knocked unconscious. All damage dealt to you should be recorded, possibly resulting in a negative hit point total. 

___
Despite any amount of damage, you remain conscious for as long as you can sustain the battle trance. When the battle trance ends, if your hit points are below zero, you collapse unconscious. If you are not healed to zero or more hit points within 1 round of your battle trance ending, you die.

### Defensive Mastery

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** You know how to turn a strong offense into an even stronger defense. Your special training or experience with defensive implements and shields allows you to capitalize on their defensive benefits far beyond the average wielder. Examples include a martial artist's defensive kata or a soldier equipped with a riot shield.
- **Effect:** When wielding a weapon or implement with the _defensive_ property, you gain an additional +1 armor bonus. In addition, the _defensive_ value of the item is increased by 1 when you wield it. So _defensive_ 1 becomes _defensive_ 2 and _defensive_ 2 becomes _defensive_ 3.

### Defensive Reflexes (I - IX)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 3:** Agility 3

### Destructive Trance

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:**
   - Might 7
   - Battle Trance
- **Description:** In the heat of combat, you become a destructive force to be reckoned with. Whether a raging barbarian or a hyper-focused intergalactic knight, your attacks become particularly ferocious when you enter your battle trance.
- **Effect:** While you are in a battle trance, in addition to dice exploding on any maximum die roll (as normal), all of the dice in your dice pool explode on the number 1 below maximum as well (though the total is still the number rolled). This means that d4s explode on a 3 or 4, d6s explode on a 5 or 6, d8s explode on a 7 or 8, and so on.

- **Effect:** Once per day, an attack that would reduce you to less than 1 HP, reduces you to 1 HP instead.

### Energy Resistance (I - IV)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 4:** None

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Agility 4

### Extraordinary Defense (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

 - **Tier 3:** Movement 4, Prescience 4, or Protection 4

### Extraordinary Focus

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Any Extraordinary 1
- **Description:** Your extraordinary power stems from your connection with a particular focus, such as a wand, digital psi amplifier, holy symbol, or spellbook. When this focus item is in your hands, you are a force to be reckoned with compared to others with similar powers.
- **Effect:** With the approval of your GM, choose a focus from which your power with a single extraordinary attribute stems. Some possibilities include a wand, a digital psi amplifier, a crystal ball, a spell book, a holy symbol, a weapon, your voice, or an animal familiar. You cannot use the selected extraordinary attribute without your focus. The focus heightens your power and for the purposes of determining your attribute dice for action rolls, you treat the chosen attribute as if it was one greater. For all purposes outside of attribute dice, your ability score remains unchanged (feats, banes, boons, etc.).
- **Special:** If you ever lose your extraordinary focus, voluntarily or involuntarily, you regain the feat points that you have spent on this feat and may spend them as usual.

 You may take this feat multiple times. If you do, select a new attribute not chosen previously. For each instance of this feat, you may choose an existing focus or select a new one.

- **Prerequisites:**

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Agility 5 and Perception 5
- **Description:** Following a trail is an everyday part of your life, and as such it is no more taxing than breathing or blinking. Whether you are an experienced woodsman, a bounty hunter for the Galactic Senate, or a humanoid cat creature with heightened senses, your expertise at tracking allows you to get it done faster than the average hunter.
- **Effect:** You can move at your full speed while tracking your quarry rather than the reduced speed typically incurred.

### Ferocious Minions (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** None
- **Description:** Whether through a pair of celestial or infernal wings, an inherent telekinetic force, or mutant super powers, you possess the ability to fly.
- **Effect:** You gain a flight speed equal to your normal speed. At the GM's discretion, certain hostile actions may be capable of canceling your flight, sending you hurtling to your doom. If your flight is anatomical, the _immobile_ bane might render your wings immovable. If telekinetic, an application of the _nullify_ bane may cancel your flight.


### Great Leap (I - III)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point

Such power is wielded by the likes of legendary enchanters, psychics, and shamans. Those who can master such powers are often capable of neutralizing angry mobs without shedding a drop of blood.
- **Effect:** 
  - **Tier 1** - When you invoke the _phantasm_ bane, you may choose to create a hallucination within a single target's mind instead of an illusion that is perceptible to everyone. You gain complete control over the target's senses (as granted by the power level of your bane), and thus the hallucination is not restricted by

  - **Tier 2** - When you invoke the hallucination form of the _phantasm_ bane, you may target additional creatures within range as determined by your Influence score. This does not count as a multi-target attack and thus does not incur disadvantage on your action roll.
   - **Influence 7** - 5 targets
   - **Influence 8** - 10 targets
   - **Influence 9** - 50 targets


### Heightened Invocation (I - III)

 - ___
 and similar characters who use extraordinary abilities to achieve great deeds.
- **Effect:** When invoking a bane or boon, you may choose to do so as a heightened invocation. The invocation time for a heightened invocation is one increment higher than usual as follows:

 - &rarr; 1 minute becomes 10 minutes
 - &rarr; 10 minutes becomes 1 hour
 - &rarr; 1 hour becomes 8 hours

 <br><br>

     - **Attribute 7** = 1 mile
     - **Attribute 8** = 10 miles
     - **Attribute 9** = 100 miles
   - Negate two levels of disadvantage caused by multi-targeting (e.g., target 2 creatures or a 10' square for free instead of disadvantage 2).

___
- 
- 
- 
-   
  - 
  ___
  For your action roll, treat your attribute score as if it was one greater for purposes of determining attribute dice. Note that this doesn't grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access. It only increases the dice used for the action roll.
 - **Tier 2** - You gain the following options when you perform a heightened invocation:
     ___
     - You can lead others to join you in group invocation as long as they are also able to invoke the bane or boon at the same power level that you are invoking it at. At the conclusion of the group invocation, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.
     - You gain the following additional options to choose from when empowering your invocations with heightened invocation:
        ___
        - Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the _nullify_ bane still works).
        - Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invoked.
 - **Tier 3** - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the invocation process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the invocation and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active heightened invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the invocation was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:
     ___
     - **Bestow Boon** - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a 
 non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will with a free action, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the _nullify_ bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).
      - **Bestow Bane** - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be cancelled either temporarily with the _nullify_ bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).
     - **Dispel Boon** - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the boon automatically.

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- 
- 
- 
- 
     ___

     - **Dispel Bane** - Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity to it. 

- **Special:** Permanently bestowing banes or boons via this feat can dramatically impact the mechanical balance of a story. Just as with other permanent effects like Extraordinary Item creation, the invocation of permanent banes or boons is subject to GM's discretion, and using this feat in a way that makes one particular character overly powerful should be prohibited.

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Creation 4, Presence 4, or Protection 4

- **Effect:** While you are in a battle trance, you are immune to banes that target your Resolve. If you were already under the effect of such a bane, it is negated for the duration of your battle trance and returns when your battle trance ends.

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

### Indomitable Endurance (I - V)

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1 - 5:** Fortitude 5 or Will 5
- **Description:** Your endurance and willpower are legendary, allowing you to push on when others would keel over from exhaustion. A barbarian able to recover their wind after a mighty frenzy, or a computer hacker capable of routinely going for days without sleep while focused on a singular objective are good examples of this feat in action.

 - **Tier 1** - A single ally that can see the attack heals <br> 1d4 HP.

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___

- Your tier in this feat determines how knowledgeable you are within your chosen sphere.

 - **Tier 1** - You automatically succeed on any action roll related to your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 16 or lower. For higher CRs, your Learning attribute is considered to be 3 for the action roll unless your Learning score is already 3 or higher, in which case you gain advantage 1 on the roll.
 - **Tier 2** - You automatically succeed on any action roll related to your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 22 or lower. For higher CRs, your Learning attribute is considered to be 6 for the action roll unless your Learning score is already 6 or higher, in which case you gain advantage 1 on the roll. 
 - **Tier 3** - You automatically succeed on any action roll related to your chosen sphere of knowledge with a CR of 26 or lower. For higher CRs, your Learning attribute is considered to be 8 for the action roll unless your Learning score is already 8 or higher, in which case you gain advantage 1 on the roll.
- **Special:** In addition to purchasing multiple tiers of this feat, you may take this feat multiple times and select a new sphere of knowledge each time. Purchasing this feat in this way confers no benefit on other spheres of knowledge.

### Longshot

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Agility 5, Might 5, or Any Extraordinary 5
- **Description:** Your expertise with a particular ranged weapon or extraordinary power enables you to strike targets at extreme distances that others would find impossible. This feat is common among snipers, fighter pilots, and war wizards.
- **Effect:** When you take this feat, select one weapon or attack type. Examples of attack types you include fire, cold, lightning, acid, poison, entropy, creation, and force - though this list is not exhaustive.

 If you choose a weapon, the weapon's range is increased to the next greater range increment. Close Ranged becomes Short, Short becomes Medium, Medium becomes Long, Long becomes Extreme, and Extreme becomes 500'.

 If you chose an attack type, your attack range for that attribute is doubled.
- **Special:** You may take this feat multiple times. If you do, select a new weapon or attack type each time.


### Martial Focus

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Agility 1 or Might 1

- **Effect:** Choose a single weapon (or choose unarmed combat), and specify the attribute that your martial focus relies upon: Agility or Might. When making attacks using your chosen weapon, your attribute is considered 1 greater for the purposes of determining attribute dice. Your attribute is not changed for purposes of feats, banes, boons, or similar items. Because of your intense focus on a single combat style, any damaging attacks that you make without your martial focus suffer disadvantage 1.

```
```

### Master Tracker

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  1 point
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Perception 4
- **Description:** You were made for the hunt. Whether you gained this ability through years of practice or possess it through heightened senses, the effect is the same: once you've picked up a trail, you almost never lose track of your quarry.
- **Effect:** Unless blinded or thwarted through extraordinary means, you always know the direction of true north. In addition, once you successfully locate the trail of a target, you automatically succeed at all tracking attempts to continue following that trail for 7 days after the time you first picked it up. Only extraordinary concealment, targets in flight, or similarly exceptional cases can cause you to lose your mark.

### Mimic

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  2 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Alteration 4 and Deception 3
- **Description:** You have honed your shapeshifting abilities to be able to not only change your form, but to even imitate specific creatures. Your powers may stem from studying the arts of deceptive magic, from a gene mutation, or even from innate extraordinary abilities.
- **Effect:** When you use the _shapeshift_ boon, you may take on the features of a specific creature. For example, instead of merely transforming into an elf, you can assume the guise of Galdion the elven king. The disguise is near perfect for those examining you visually. If your behavior or other signs provide reasonable suspicion, an onlooker can attempt a Perception roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + triple your Alteration or Deception score, whichever is higher. If they succeed, they will recognize your disguise.

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___

 - **Tier 1 - 6:** None
- **Description:** Whether you are delivering a flurry of blows, wielding two weapons, or calling a chain of lightning bolts from the sky, you have mastered the art of delivering multiple attacks.
- **Effect:** At the start of your turn, you may declare that you are multi-attacking. You must state how many extra attacks you would like to make. You receive a corresponding number of additional major actions, which can only be used for attacks. _All_ of your attacks this round suffer disadvantage equal to 3 times the number of **additional** attacks you declare (i.e., if you make 2 attacks, you suffer disadvantage 3; 3 attacks suffers disadvantage 6). For each tier of this feat that you possess, reduce the disadvantage penalty by 1.
 
 You may use your attacks to make any combination of bane or damaging attacks, but you may not invoke boons.

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- 
- 
- 
- Resolve each attack individually, applying any other multi-targeting options as you wish. You can move between each of these attacks and they can be used to target the same creature more than once. 
 The number of additional attacks you can make with this feat is limited to 1 + half your level, rounded up. Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level.
- **Example** - Vax the Deathbringer has Multi-Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10'-cube. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.



### Multi-Bane Specialist

<div class="feat-entry"></div>

___
- **Cost:**  3 points
- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Ability to inflict both banes (see description)
- **Description:** You have mastered a signature attack that allows you to invoke two banes at once. A blast of ice that blinds and slows your enemy, a thunderous shotgun blast that hurls foes back and knocks them to the ground, and a wormtongue song that puts targets to sleep and alters their memory are all examples of a signature attack that could be created with this feat.
- **Effect:** Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining _knockdown_ and _slowed_, both power level 1, would require an attribute score of 2). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.
- **Special:** In order to benefit from the bane focus feat when using a multi-bane attack, you must possess bane focus for both banes.

 You may take this feat more than once. If you do, you must choose a different pair of banes for the new instance of the feat.

A half-ogre wielding a massive tree branch and a super soldier trained to use the enemy's weight against themself are both examples of this feat in play.
- **Effect:**  Each time you deal damage using a weapon that has the _forceful_ property, you can choose to push the target five feet away from you.

- **Prerequisites:**
 - **Tier 1:** Ability to invoke the chosen bane
- **Description:** You are so adept at a particular form of attack that your foes struggle to shake off the effects. Perhaps the flames of your fireballs burn hotter.

- **Effect:** You can enter a battle trance (as per the Battle Trance feat) as a free action even when it is not your turn. You may choose to do so in reaction to another action, such as an enemy's attack, spell, or insult. You may even declare your intent to enter a battle trance after the action has been resolved (such as after the attack has already been rolled). The benefits granted from your battle trance take place before the triggering action is resolved, potentially negating damage or harmful effects that you would have otherwise incurred.
