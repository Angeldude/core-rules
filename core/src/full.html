<p>*Deep in the bowels of a long abandoned star freighter, a pair of rogues huddle around a dusty stasis pod. One of them, covered head to toe in cybernetic implants, attempts to make sense of the alien symbols painted on the pod in dried blood.</p>
<p><em>“Hold that light steady!” he mutters to his companion.</em></p>
<p><em>But his whispers carry far in the long corridors and endless ventilation shafts of the Zeta class cruiser, and soon the echoes are like a siren in the darkness. Pairs of red eyes awaken at the edge of the light, fires of malice that yearn for the flesh of the intruders. “Spaz,” stutters the lightbearer as he draws a shining six-shooter, “I don’t think this freighter is abandoned no more.”</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>The death throes of the orcs can be heard two realms over as they fall in waves to the heroes making their last stand upon the Ruins of Ravenwatch. Still, there is no end in sight to the horde that blackens the hills like a swarm of locusts.</em></p>
<p><em>“They come for the Stone,” grunts a dwarf, pulling his axe from the skull of another pig-headed orc. “Just give it to them, and maybe we’ll get out of this alive.”</em></p>
<p><em>It is an elven maiden, tall and clad in battleworn mail, who replies: “I’ll have no bard sing tales of Luthiel the Cowardly, who surrendered to orc scum while still she drew breath.”</em></p>
<p><em>As elf and dwarf bicker, a grey haired man, cloaked in emerald, stands tall atop a boulder at the center of the ruins. His eyes stare distantly, like sharp daggers, at the golden sun landing upon the horizon. With a smirk, he raises his gnarled oaken staff to the sky, where the gathering storm clouds crackle with the fury of nature’s electric potential. “Gentleman, lady…” speaks the druid with soft confidence, “I think the winds have turned in our favor.”</em></p>

<h3 id="why-open-legend">Why Open Legend?</h3>
<p>If you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering What makes Open Legend worth my time? What makes it different?</p>
<p>The secret’s in the title: Open. Everything about the game is about opening up the doors of possibility so that every table tells a legend worth telling. Here are a few of the possibilities that Open Legend offers.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong>. That’s right. The core rules are with accomodation for <a href="/commercial-terms">commercial</a> and <a href="/noncommercial-terms">non-commercial</a> derivative works. We know the public will love the game as much as we do, and we hope they’ll spread the love by publishing their own adventures, rules supplements, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Open Dice</strong>. In Open Legend, dice explode! That means that whenever ANY die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. The volatile nature of dice rolling makes every roll count, and each session of Open Legend is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment’s notice, for better or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Open Legend</strong>. You get to tell the story that you want to tell, with the characters you want to play. You aren’t tied down to specific class, archetype, or race combinations. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM’s veto power). Rather than a list of set classes with a menu of skills to pick from, you start the game with attribute points that you spend as you wish to give your character the powers she needs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Open Legend, a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players take the part of mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion. As in the vignettes above, every game of Open Legend revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, outsmart cunning foes, break ancient curses, crack baffling cases, discover untold treasures, and more.</p>
<p>If you have never played a roleplaying game before, you can think of it as a movie in which the actors make up the script (and even much of the plot) as the movie is being shot. One player, called the <strong>Game Master</strong> (or GM), acts as producer, director, and writer. The GM establishes the setting, creates the antagonists, and develops enough plot to get the other players started. The GM also acts out the part of the villains and neutral characters in the story.</p>
<p>The rest of the players take the role of <strong>Player Characters</strong> (or PCs). The PCs are the protagonists of the story. In a high fantasy setting, one PC might be a dwarven warrior with a lust for gems, another an immortal elven wizard whose only desire is knowledge, and still another a half-angelic priest who travels the world in order to inspire others to act justly. In another game of Open Legend, the players might star as a rag tag crew of space pirates living from score to score on their barely functioning merchant ship. All the common tropes could make an appearance: the reckless pilot, the brash captain with a troubled past, the hired gun, the stowaway, and the engineer who gets along with the ship better than with the crew.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivation of their characters, the players share a common goal: to take the plot and setting established by the GM and have fun. At some tables, this might look like J.R.R Tolkien’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. In others, it might look more like <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em>. Whatever fun looks like at your table, Open Legend will be a part of it.</p>
<p>This is your story. Tell it.</p>
<h2 id="what-defines-open-legend">What Defines Open Legend?</h2>
<p><em>Open Legend</em> is a game designed for players who want enough rules to make a game fair, but not so many that the rules interfere with the fun or imagination. <em>Open Legend</em> provides a way to make sure that the game is balanced while adjusting the story of character abilities on the fly. The rules should be robust, but their only value is in telling a story</p>
<p>Altering a spell that does lightning damage and stuns its victims to do cold damage and slow them takes no extra effort in <em>Open Legend</em>, due to its streamlined system for secondary effects (banes) and multi-target attacks. These mechanics are the same for all characters (even those without extraordinary abilities), regardless of their unique story, but the description of how it looks varies wildly.</p>
<p>As storytellers, we love intricate plotlines that feature characters of depth and beauty. But as gamers, we also love rolling dice. If all we wanted to do with our friends was tell stories, we would write a novel together or join an improv theater group.</p>
<p>What we want to do is game. And that means we need rules.</p>
<p>Without well-defined rules, the decisions made by players and GMs can seem arbitrary or inconsistent. The GM may feel overburdened by a constant need to recall past rulings that she’s made, and the players may feel like their decisions don’t actually matter because the GM can interpret them however she wants. This is the opposite of how a baseball ref operates. The ref doesn’t need to create new rules for every play that he calls. The rules of the game are already spelled out. He just needs to interpret and apply them.</p>
<p><em>Open Legend</em> was designed to provide enough rules so that players have a clear framework to guide their play, but not so many rules that the game gets bogged down by them. You spend your day job worrying about bookkeeping and policies. We don’t want the gaming table to feel like that, and we designed <em>Open Legend</em> to focus on the fun rather than the homework.</p>
<p>For example, you won’t have long lists of resources to manage. Any abilities that you can use or spells you can cast in <em>Open Legend</em> can be used at-will. Likewise, spellcasters, psions, and techies don’t need to worry about poring over page after page of power descriptions in order to make the right choices. Instead, <em>Open Legend</em> uses a system of <strong>banes</strong> and <strong>boons</strong>, or status effects, that any character can apply if he is built to do so.</p>
<p>Other mechanics that will ensure that you can focus on the story you want to tell include simplified wealth and encumbrance systems. In <em>Open Legend</em>, you’ll never need to record a single gold piece on your character sheet or even think about how many pounds your revolver weighs.</p>
<p><em>Open Legend</em> straddles the line by giving the best of both worlds, emphasizing both storytelling and strategy at the same time, placing less restrictions on both.</p>
<p>We hope that we’ve built a game for players who love to tell a good story but don’t want every decision to be made on a whim.</p>
<p>We hope that we’ve built a game for players who love to shake the dice and see them roll but don’t want to spend hours min-maxing their characters.</p>
<p>Most of all, we hope that we’ve built a game for players like you.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-mechanic-the-action-roll">The Core Mechanic: The Action Roll</h2>
<p>Most meaningful tasks that a character attempts in <em>Open Legend</em> will be determined by the roll of dice.</p>
<p>To determine the outcome, you roll 1d20 plus any bonus dice granted by your character’s attribute that is most relevant to the task. Any dice that roll the maximum possible explode, which means you can roll them again and add the new total to your action roll as well. Continue rerolling dice until none of them explode.</p>
<p>Add all of the dice together to find your total action roll. If your total is equal to or greater than the action’s Challenge Rating, then you succeed. Otherwise, the GM decides that you either succeed with a twist or fail in a way that allows the story to progress.</p>

<h3 id="example-action-roll">Example Action Roll</h3>
<p>An adventuring party is traveling through the Darkwood, a forest cursed with malignant energy and cast in shadows at every turn. The party spies a gathering of lights in the distance ahead. At the same time, though, a Shade Demon has crept up behind the heroes. The GM tells Imladril, the elven ranger who is at the back of the marching order, to make a Perception roll against a Challenge Rating of 18. Imladril’s Perception score of 5 grants him a 2d6 bonus to Perception action rolls, so he grabs 1d20 + 2d6 and lets them fly.</p>
<p>He rolls a 7 on the d20, and the d6s come up 1 and 6. Since the 6 explodes, Imladril rolls it again and gets a 3, for a grand total of 17 (7+1+6+3), just shy of the required 18. The GM decides to allow Imladril to <strong>succeed with a twist</strong>, so she rules that he hears the demon fast enough to alert the party, but that the demon has already closed into melee distance and is able to knock the ranger’s bow out of his hands.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the GM could decide that Imladril <strong>fails, but the story progresses</strong>. For example, she rules that the demon is able to grab the ranger and drag him silently into the darkness completely unbeknownst to the rest of the party distracted by the lights in the distance.</p>

<p>Action rolls and exploding dice are just the start of what makes <em>Open Legend</em> a blast to play. Read on to discover how to build the character you’ve always wanted to play, equip him for adventure, explore unknown worlds, and perform epic feats of heroism.</p>
<h1 id="chapter-1-character-creation">Chapter 1: Character Creation</h1>
<p>Before you can start telling your story, you’ll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In <em>Open Legend</em>, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.</p>
<p>Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.</p>
<p><em>Who were the characters you identified with?</em></p>
<p><em>Who inspired you?</em></p>
<p>Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.</p>
<h3 id="choose-an-example-character-modify-it">Choose an Example Character &amp; Modify It</h3>
<p>For anyone who feels they could benefit from some inspiration, you can easily make a copy of any of these spreadsheets (they include formulas for doing most all of the calculations for you), and then increase or decrease attribute scores, as well as add or remove feats. Be sure to adjust the <strong>Level</strong> field to get the correct calculations for attribute &amp; feat points at your current character level.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bx_UrXHMi3wmUlJjbDZiaGtIX00"><strong>View Pre-generated Character Options</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="step-1-describe-your-character">Step 1: Describe Your Character</h2>
<p><em>Open Legend</em> is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear that we will learn about in later steps. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p>
<p><strong>A heroic name.</strong> Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.</p>
<p><strong>Your race.</strong> Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.</p>
<p>As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your <strong>size</strong>: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10’x10’ square in combat and has a 10’ reach (see Chapter 6: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.</p>
<p>At the GM’s discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the sizes described above. A large creature’s reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15’x15’ base would have a 15’ reach. Small creatures always have at least a 5’ reach.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="no-racial-abilities-or-adjustments">No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?</h3>
<p>In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in the a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing the aforementioned psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the <em>scent</em> perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the <em>observant</em> perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the <em>hot tempered</em> flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Two exceptional physical traits.</strong> Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?</p>
<p><strong>Two defining social traits. </strong>Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.</p>
<p><strong>A secret.</strong> Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="example-character-secrets">Example Character Secrets</h3>
<p>Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child–that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.</p>
<hr />
<p>Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive &gt; with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, physically and mentally.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="step-2-choose-attributes">Step 2: Choose Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes are the backbone of every character in <em>Open Legend</em>. They define what your character can and can’t do–the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.</p>
<p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, attributes are divided into four categories: physical, social, mental, and extraordinary.</p>
<p>A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero.</p>
<p>The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.</p>
<p>The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.</p>

<p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.</p>

<h3 id="roll-them-bones">Roll Them Bones</h3>
<p>If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.</p>
<p>As you play Open Legend, you’ll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. <strong>Dice notation</strong> is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.</p>
<p>Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the <em>d</em> indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the <em>d</em> indicates how many sides those dice have.</p>
<p>So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.</p>
<p>4d4 indicates four four-sided dice.</p>
<p>And so on.</p>

<p>When an enemy tries to attack you–whether with the shot of a rifle, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault–it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.</p>

<p><em>That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 6: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-purchase-feats">Step 4: Purchase Feats</h2>
<p>While your character’s attributes define his skill at accomplishing heroic tasks, his <strong>feats</strong> are what make him unique among other characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.</p>
<p>For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so they take the <em>Combat Momentum</em> feat to allow them to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes <em>Berserker</em> so that they can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate their foes.</p>
<h3 id="choose-your-feats">Choose your feats</h3>
<p>Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.</p>
<p>You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats"><em>here</em></a>.</p>
<p>If your character is based on a specific archetype, you may want to start with the feat selections recommended below:</p>

<p>Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.</p>
<p>Instead of purchasing equipment a la carte, you may also elect to choose one of the following starting packages built for common character archetypes. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-choose-perks-and-flaws">Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws</h2>
<p>In addition to the descriptive details you have just created, you may also choose up to two perks and up to two flaws from the following lists.</p>
<p>Perks are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.</p>
<p>Flaws are your Achilles’ heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won’t accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you’re blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.</p>
<h3 id="activating-perks">Activating Perks</h3>
<p>Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the <em>profession</em> perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their <em>profession: hunter</em> perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC’s experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.</p>
<h3 id="activating-flaws">Activating Flaws</h3>
<p>While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in the future.</p>
<p>You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the <em>disabled</em> flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that they’re usually completely unaffected by their blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder them.</p>
<p>To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.</p>
<p>The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It’s also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="examples-of-activating-flaws">Examples of Activating Flaws</h3>
<p>Oxnar the Barbarian was never known for his brains, so when the pixie promised him that eating the golden mushroom would make him as strong as a hundred mules, he gobbled it up with no questions and much gusto. A minute later he was dozing in a puddle of his own drool as the imp made off with his coin purse. The GM awards Oxnar with a legend point for effectively roleplaying his <em>dimwitted</em> flaw to his own detriment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Normally, Celeste’s blindness from the <em>disabled</em> flaw doesn’t stop her from being one of the best shots in the Badlands. Her keen hearing and extrasensory perception more than make up for her lack of sight. The unearthly wailing of these zombie shriekers, however, have overwhelmed her senses. The player who is role-playing Celeste decides that the situation is dicey enough that she will unintentionally target one of her allies. She lets the GM know that she is specifically activating her disabled flaw, and the GM agrees that the impact is significant enough to merit a legend point for adding a new level of depth and realism to the story the group is telling together.</p>
<hr />
<p>The psion Madrina has the <em>ambitious</em> flaw. After rescuing a group of mining colony civilians from a catastrophic air lock breach, Madrina is given the chance to ask a reward of the Chancellor. Madrina asks for the hand of the Chancellor’s eldest in marriage, rather than a more reasonable request such as currency or similar. The Chancellor becomes infuriated, but the GM awards a legend point for role-playing a flaw in a way that furthers the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="gaining-perks-and-flaws">Gaining Perks and Flaws</h3>
<p>At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the <em>profession: sailor</em> perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the <em>physical deformity</em> flaw to describe your scarred face.</p>
<p>You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM’s approval as your character’s personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the <em>cowardly</em> flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the <em>artisan</em> perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws.</p>
<h3 id="designing-your-own-perks-and-flaws">Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws</h3>
<p>The lists provided here are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.</p>
<p>Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.</p>
<p>Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the <em>artisan</em> perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the <em>attractive</em> perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the <em>idol</em> perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.</p>
<h3 id="perk-list">Perk List</h3>
<h4 id="ageless">Ageless</h4>
<p>Whether you are an android constructed of spaceage material that does not erode over time, the loyal servant of a higher power, or the subject of an arcane ritual, you have unlocked the secret to immortality. You are immune to the passage of time and the effects of old age. Your body does not age and you cannot be harmed by extraordinary effects that cause aging. Based on the source of your agelessness, you can decide whether or not your appearance changes over time.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-bloodline">Arcane Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your ancestry can be traced to dragons, fey, or a similarly magical race. As such, you command the respect of those who practice the arcane arts. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the ways of magic, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="artisan">Artisan</h4>
<p>Choose a specific craft, such as weapon smithing, glass blowing, or brewing. You know the ins and outs of crafting goods of the highest quality within your chosen specialty. As a master craftsman, you are able to create items of exceptional value given the necessary time and materials. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your crafting skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.</p>
<h4 id="ascetic">Ascetic</h4>
<p>You are well-versed in the art of living with less. Whether a cloistered monk or a wizened sage who spent years locked away in a tower of books, you are experienced at going long stretches of time with very little food, water, or company - and as such, these situations tend not to affect you as they do others. You are hardened against physical and mental deprivation and have developed an enviable degree of self-mastery.</p>
<h4 id="attractive">Attractive</h4>
<p>You are just really darn good looking. This plays to your favor more than just romantically, and your good looks tend to help you out in all sorts of social situations. Whenever your attractiveness would play a role in a situation, you gain advantage 1 to any relevant action rolls.</p>
<h4 id="brute">Brute</h4>
<p>While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear. Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your <em>Might</em> attribute for a <em>Persuasion</em> roll. If your <em>Persuasion</em> score is already equal to or greater than your <em>Might</em> score, you get advantage 1 on the roll.</p>
<h4 id="courageous">Courageous</h4>
<p>Your heart is brave beyond bounds. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel all negative effects upon you related to fear or low morale.</p>
<h4 id="crowd-favorite">Crowd Favorite</h4>
<p>Whether you are an actor, musician, storyteller, magician, or some other type of performer, the common folk love your work. They adore you for your ability to use your art to transport them to a world beyond their daily drudgery, and you can always find a place to perform and make money at the local tavern or inn.</p>
<h4 id="divine-agent">Divine Agent</h4>
<p>You serve a higher being and have earned their protection. Once per game session, when you are subject to a <em>Finishing Blow</em> while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.</p>
<h4 id="divine-insight">Divine Insight</h4>
<p>You possess a supernatural connection to a deity, demi-god, or other divine being which grants you otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story. The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful. If you’ve just failed a <em>Learning</em> attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.</p>
<h4 id="ear-of-the-emperor">Ear of the Emperor</h4>
<p>You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.</p>
<h4 id="idol">Idol</h4>
<p>Your reputation for some outstanding virtue precedes you, and people tend to hold you in high esteem. Once per session, you can call upon your reputation to inspire trust from someone who is skeptical of you, your actions, or your allies.</p>
<h4 id="innocent">Innocent</h4>
<p>Whether from a distant fey ancestry or simply an air of naivety, you possess a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.</p>
<h4 id="jack-of-all-trades">Jack of All Trades</h4>
<p>You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided its Challenge Rating is less than or equal to 14.</p>
<h4 id="local-hero">Local Hero</h4>
<p>You are well-known and respected as a protector of the common folk in a small region. The commoners look up to you, and will offer you food, shelter, and other necessities. They will even take risks or assume minor costs to aid or protect you, so long as the risk is not death.</p>
<h4 id="lucky">Lucky</h4>
<p>Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck shine to upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.</p>
<h4 id="merchant">Merchant</h4>
<p>You know the art of economics as well as the best of businessmen. A master of supply and demand, you have a knack for knowing when to buy and when to sell. You cannot be swindled when it comes to bartering, and you always know whether or not you are getting a fair price. Furthermore, you have friends in merchant circles and guilds in your home city, and you can easily gain them in new locations.</p>
<h4 id="noble">Noble</h4>
<p>Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.</p>
<h4 id="observant">Observant</h4>
<p>Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a <em>Perception</em> roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.</p>
<h4 id="outlaw">Outlaw</h4>
<p>You are part of a criminal network, whether it be a thieves’ guild, band of smugglers, or otherwise. Once per game session, you can call in a favor from a contact within your network to perform a mundane task such as gathering information or arranging safe passage. If the favor puts your contact at risk, they will still perform it but may ask for an equally risky favor from you in return.</p>
<h4 id="profession">Profession</h4>
<p>Choose a specific trade, such as sailor, soldier, or miner. You know everything there is to know about the business and are a master of the requisite skills. A sailor, for example, can tie a knot for all occasions, navigate by the stars, and man any station aboard a ship. A soldier is well-versed in a variety of arms, understands military tactics, and knows how to navigate the chain of command with ease. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your professional skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make.</p>
<h4 id="pure-hearted">Pure-hearted</h4>
<p>Any goodly-natured creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.</p>
<h4 id="resilient">Resilient</h4>
<p>Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a Fortitude action roll of Challenge Rating less than or equal to 10 + twice your Fortitude score.</p>
<h4 id="scavenger">Scavenger</h4>
<p>You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sun-baked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.</p>
<h4 id="scent">Scent</h4>
<p>Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’. Furthermore, you gain advantage 1 on attempts to track a creature if it has left a scent trail.</p>
<h4 id="scholar">Scholar</h4>
<p>You have spent years studying a particular discipline, such as science, herbalism, dragon lore, history, politics, or religion. Once per session, you can re-roll a failed <em>Learning</em> check related to your discipline, gaining advantage 2 on the re-roll. Furthermore, you have colleagues and connections within your discipline, and know the proper channels for gaining access to specialty laboratories, libraries, temples, or other collections of lore related to your field of scholarship.</p>
<h4 id="silver-tongue">Silver Tongue</h4>
<p>You have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.</p>
<h4 id="stone-sense">Stone Sense</h4>
<p>While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered. Furthermore, you have advantage 1 on any action rolls in which a familiarity with underground environments would prove helpful, such as attempts to identify the risk of a cave in or to find a secret passage within a cavern.</p>
<h4 id="street-rat">Street Rat</h4>
<p>You were raised on the streets or at least spent a good deal of time crawling about them. As such, you know how to navigate urban areas quickly, make yourself unseen, and find a bite to eat when you’re down on your luck. As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets.</p>
<h4 id="extraordinary-presence">Extraordinary Presence</h4>
<p>Your inherent extraordinary nature manifests itself in a tangible way of your choosing. For example, your eyes may glow, your skin might emanate an icy chill, or a trail of withering plants could follow you wherever you set foot. Depending on the nature of your extraordinary presence, it might make others more likely to fear, admire, or trust you–or otherwise alter their initial perceptions of you. Whenever your extraordinary presence is relevant in a social situation, you gain advantage 1 on any action rolls you make.</p>
<h4 id="sylvan-ally">Sylvan Ally</h4>
<p>Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your reputation for defending nature.</p>
<h4 id="vagabond">Vagabond</h4>
<p>Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild. You always know the direction of true north and you can automatically find enough food to feed yourself plus a number of additional people equal to your Learning attribute score.</p>
<h4 id="warriors-code">Warrior’s Code</h4>
<p>As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.</p>
<h4 id="whisperer-of-the-wild">Whisperer of the Wild</h4>
<p>Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.</p>
<h3 id="flaw-list">Flaw List</h3>
<h4 id="absent-minded">Absent-minded</h4>
<p>Your live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.</p>
<h4 id="addiction">Addiction</h4>
<p>The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you’ve got an itch that you need to scratch, and you’ll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.</p>
<h4 id="ambitious">Ambitious</h4>
<p>You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it’s typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.</p>
<h4 id="bloodlust">Bloodlust</h4>
<p>Battle isn’t just a way of life, it is <em>the</em> way of life. There isn’t a conflict you’ve encountered that wasn’t best solved with steel, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren’t necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.</p>
<h4 id="brash">Brash</h4>
<p>You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a peck of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.</p>
<h4 id="bravado">Bravado</h4>
<p>You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.</p>
<h4 id="cosmetic-deformity">Cosmetic Deformity</h4>
<p>Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.</p>
<h4 id="compulsion">Compulsion</h4>
<p>You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.</p>
<h4 id="cowardly">Cowardly</h4>
<p>You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harms way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.</p>
<h4 id="dimwitted">Dimwitted</h4>
<p>You aren’t the sharpest tack in the box. It’s not just that you weren’t gifted with skill in academia, it’s that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.</p>
<h4 id="disabled">Disabled</h4>
<p>You have some physical deficiency that holds you back in life. You decide the nature and severity of your disability. Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.</p>
<h4 id="greedy">Greedy</h4>
<p>You can’t help it: you just like things. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you’ll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You’re easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.</p>
<h4 id="honest">Honest</h4>
<p>You won’t tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.</p>
<h4 id="hot-tempered">Hot Tempered</h4>
<p>Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive. Sometimes your anger boils slowly over time and other times it erupts completely unexpectedly. But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.</p>
<h4 id="illiterate">Illiterate</h4>
<p>You can’t read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.</p>
<h4 id="literal-minded">Literal Minded</h4>
<p>You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerated by saying “I’d kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend’s life if Melzak did get elected.</p>
<h4 id="mood-disorder">Mood Disorder</h4>
<p>You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety. You get to to determine the nature and severity of your mood disorder.</p>
<h4 id="naive">Naive</h4>
<p>Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you’re a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.</p>
<h4 id="overt">Overt</h4>
<p>You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.</p>
<h4 id="overweight">Overweight</h4>
<p>You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.</p>
<h4 id="pacifist">Pacifist</h4>
<p>You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won’t lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.</p>
<h4 id="phobia">Phobia</h4>
<p>You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence, a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.</p>
<h4 id="proud">Proud</h4>
<p>Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you’re not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Space Marines leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.</p>
<h4 id="psychotic">Psychotic</h4>
<p>You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality. You get to determine the extent and nature of your psychosis, including any potential triggers. For example, you might believe that beings from another dimension are trying to abduct you, or perhaps you relive a nightmarish scene from your past whenever you are in the midst of a gun fight.</p>
<h4 id="short-winded">Short-winded</h4>
<p>You have poor lung capacity and easily tire. Sprints, long runs, and forced marches are either impossible for you or they tend to leave you completely incapacitated afterwards.</p>
<h4 id="sick">Sick</h4>
<p>You suffer from some sort of chronic illness or condition, such as tuberculosis, cancer, arthritis, or irritable bowel syndrome. Even if you possess the means to treat your disease or control the symptoms, you might still have episodes or flare ups that hinder your adventuring life.</p>
<h4 id="socially-awkward">Socially Awkward</h4>
<p>Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don’t respect the personal space of others, you tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.</p>
<h4 id="stubborn">Stubborn</h4>
<p>It’s your way or the highway. Maybe not all of the time, but once you’ve made your mind up on an important matter, you won’t budge. You probably won’t even compromise.</p>
<h4 id="uncoordinated">Uncoordinated</h4>
<p>Your body just doesn’t work well with itself. You have trouble balancing, catching, throwing, and performing similar physical tasks that require dexterity or nimbleness.</p>
<h4 id="vengeful">Vengeful</h4>
<p>You let no slight go unpunished. While some might be able to shake off an insult from a tavern drunk, you take it as a personal assault that demands satisfaction. The more severe the crime, the greater the vengeance you will mete out.</p>
<h4 id="zealous">Zealous</h4>
<p>You stand for a cause - whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise - and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause.</p>
<h3 id="tell-your-story">Tell Your Story</h3>
<p>With your character created, you are all ready to start playing <em>Open Legend</em>. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.</p>
<h3 id="relax">Relax</h3>
<p><em>Open Legend </em>gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels–but whatever you do, shake the dice like your life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="respect-the-gm">Respect the GM</h3>
<p>If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of the game.</p>
<h3 id="respect-the-other-players">Respect the Other Players</h3>
<p>Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing <em>Open Legend</em>, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.</p>
<h2 id="gaining-xp-and-leveling-up">Gaining XP and Leveling Up</h2>
<p>As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.</p>
<p>Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters, NPCs, and monsters. Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.</p>

<h3 id="feat-and-attribute-points">Feat and Attribute Points</h3>
<p>For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points <em>every</em> time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.</p>
<p>Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.</p>
<h3 id="new-hit-points">New Hit Points</h3>
<p>In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.</p>

<p>The Introduction and Chapter 1 provided you with the core mechanic for action resolution as well as a brief overview of what the different attributes are used for. This chapter will delve a little bit deeper, explaining when to make different types of action rolls and how to interpret the results.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-roll-the-dice">When to Roll the Dice</h2>
<p><em>Open Legend</em> is about creating great stories full of epic moments of heroism, and you roll dice to determine the outcome of those moments. In short, you only need to make action rolls when the outcome of the intended action plays a significant role in the story. In combat, for example, you’ll be making plenty of action rolls to clash blades, sling spells, and leap over treacherous chasms. But you don’t need to roll a Persuasion check every time you go to buy something from the bazaar, and you don’t need to roll Logic to remember where you left the key to your room at the inn.</p>
<h2 id="every-roll-matters">Every Roll Matters</h2>
<p>Another important point in <em>Open Legend</em> is that every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by a successful roll from another character.</p>
<p>If you look back to the Core Mechanic, you can see that a simple failure is not an option:</p>

</table>
<p>Here’s an example to illustrate how to make every roll matter.</p>
<p><em>Pelias Quickenfit, a halfling burglar, is attempting to pick the lock on a door. He rolls an Agility check but gets lower than the challenge rating.</em></p>
<h3 id="what-not-to-do">What NOT to do</h3>
<p>In this case, what might often happen at a gaming table is that upon seeing the halfling’s failure, another character immediately steps forward, say the barbarian, and attempts to force the door down. In <em>Open Legend</em>, such a reaction is frowned upon because it would mean that the burglar’s roll didn’t matter. It didn’t drive the story at all. Instead, the barbarian should wait for the GM to interpret the result of Pelias’s roll. Here are two potential outcomes for the roll:</p>
<p><em>If the GM chooses <strong>success with a twist</strong>, they might rule that Pelias is able to open the lock; however, just as he finishes the job, he begins to hear a faint hissing sound from the door. A poison gas trap! The burglar immediately falls unconscious, and the rest of the party must decide what to do before the gas reaches them in a matter of seconds.</em></p>
<p><em>If the GM chooses <strong>failure, but the story progresses</strong>, they might rule that although Pelias is unable to get the lock open, he hears footsteps approaching from around the corner accompanied by the familiar jingle of a jailer’s keychain. If the party can position themselves quickly enough, they may be able to get the keys without a fight.</em></p>
<p>Notice how both of these options allow Pelias’s action to drive the story forward just as much as a successful roll would have. In the second example, perhaps the barbarian still ends up bashing the door down with brute force, but at least the story moved on in some way because of the burglar’s attempts.</p>
<p>The GM has a right to interpret the results of a failed action roll so that they can ensure that every roll matters. Players should make a special effort to avoid stepping on the GM’s toes in this regard.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="old-habits-die-hard">Old Habits Die Hard</h3>
<p>If you’ve played other RPGs in the past, you may be tempted to immediately follow another player’s failed roll with an action roll of your own.</p>
<p>The following are common situations in which you should be especially vigilant to give the GM time to interpret the results of a failed action roll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception rolls to find secret doors or other hidden objects</li>
<li>Perception rolls to notice when someone is lying</li>
<li>Persuasion rolls to convince an NPC of something</li>
<li>Learning rolls to recall useful information</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="keep-it-simple-every-roll-matters-for-the-gm">Keep It Simple: Every Roll Matters for the GM</h3>
<p>The “every roll matters” rule was designed to make player actions meaningful to the story whether they succeed or fail. It recognizes the fact that static pass/fail checks aren’t particularly fun for players. But “every roll matters” also adds an extra layer of complexity to the game because it requires the GM to make on-the-fly interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>So when the GM makes a roll</strong>, a success is a success and a failure is a failure.</p>
<p>This is for the sake of simplicity and fun. When a player fails a roll, it’s not very fun if something doesn’t come out of it. When the GM fails a roll, though, there is usually much rejoicing at the table.</p>
<h2 id="interpreting-action-rolls">Interpreting Action Rolls</h2>
<p>The previous example provides just one method in which a GM might interpret the results of an action roll, but there is a little more to it than that. In this section, you’ll get some empowering guidelines to help everyone at the table feel comfortable with the amount of improvisation required for <em>Open Legend</em>.</p>
<h3 id="interpreting-success">Interpreting Success</h3>
<p>A successful action roll is by far the easiest to interpret: it means that the player gets what they were hoping for. If they were rolling to climb a cliff, then they climb it. If they were trying to pick a pocket, then it’s picked. If they were trying to stab an orc, it is stabbed. And so on.</p>
<p>In some cases, the results of a success are already written into the rules (such as in combat, explained in Chapter 6). Often, though, the GM will need to determine what happens with a successful action roll.</p>
<p>There are two primary factors to consider when adjudicating a success:</p>
<p><strong>Don’t roll if there’s nothing to succeed at.</strong> For example, if a character wants to search a corridor for secret passages, but the GM knows there aren’t any, they don’t need to have the character roll a Perception check, because there’s nothing to find; the roll doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>Describe your success.</strong> Whenever the situation allows, the player should show the rest of the table what success looks like. It’s their turn in the spotlight, so let them shine. If your rogue successfully disarms a trap, describe how the scything blade just barely nicked your cheek before you finished the job. If your barbarian makes a successful leap attack against the orc chieftain, narrate how you knock their shield aside with your first blow before coming down on their skull with your axe. Sometimes, of course, the GM has privileged information, so they need to be the one to describe things. Whenever possible, though, the players should describe their own success.</p>
<h3 id="interpreting-success-with-a-twist">Interpreting Success with a Twist</h3>
<p>When a player fails an action roll, the GM may choose to allow the player’s action to succeed with a twist. In this case, the player gets what they wanted originally, but there is some sort of unintended consequence or unexpected cost. The following list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a pretty good idea of what qualifies as a twist.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Put a character in danger</strong></li>
<li><strong>Expend a resource</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make an enemy or lose a friend</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overlook an important detail</strong></li>
<li><strong>Waste time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Attract attention</strong></li>
<li><strong>Find something you weren’t looking for</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The important thing to realize is that a success with a twist is still a success. It just comes at some sort of a cost: You find the trail of the hydra you’re tracking, but it leads you through a swamp infested with undead. You sense that the merchant is overcharging you, but you fail to realize that he’s also distracting you from the thugs sneaking up behind you. You are able to hit the wyvern with your bow, but it costs you your last arrow.</p>
<h3 id="interpreting-failure-but-the-story-progresses">Interpreting Failure, but the Story Progresses</h3>
<p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, a failure is never just a failure, it’s always an important element in the story, hence the rule that “the story progresses”.</p>
<p>Progress, though, can mean a lot of things. When the GM selects this option, the following interpretations should give you some idea of how the story can progress in spite of failure.</p>
<p><strong>The player finds an opportunity for success.</strong> Even though your magic fails to dispel the curse afflicting your ally, you discover during later study that a rare herb growing in a nearby forest would give you the power you require.</p>
<p><strong>The danger snowballs.</strong> You fail to jump a chasm while fleeing a band of cannibals. You fall along the cliffside, taking some damage. When you gather your senses, you realize that you aren’t only separated from the rest of your party, but you’ve also fallen into the nest of a Roc.</p>
<p><strong>The information is false.</strong> You think you’ve got a good read on the mayor during your negotiations. It seems like they’re completely in favor of your plan to negotiate an alliance with the neighboring dwarves. When you set out the next day, however, it turns out you were wrong, and the guards they sent to ensure your safe passage turn out to be your assassins.</p>
<p>The GM gets to decide how bad a failed action roll turns out to be, and sometimes, it’s really bad. While some of these examples are harsher than others, they all share one common factor: they steer the narrative forward. Failure is never just a failure.</p>
<h2 id="determining-challenge-rating">Determining Challenge Rating</h2>
<p>Many actions that you will undertake in <em>Open Legend</em> have a Challenge Rating (CR) that is determined by the rules. Attacks in combat, for example, use one of the target’s defense scores as the CR.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, though, the GM will need to determine the CR for actions that aren’t spelled out clearly in the rules. In these cases, the GM can use the Challenge Ratings by Difficulty Table to set an appropriate CR.</p>

</table>
<p>It’s important to note that Challenge Ratings are not typically set to be relative to the party’s level. So, breaking down a strong wooden door is CR 15 whether the party is first level or tenth.</p>
<h3 id="contested-actions">Contested Actions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, two or more characters are directly opposing each other in a test of strength, wits, or charm. For example, a mighty barbarian wrestles with a minotaur to get hold of a magical gem. Or three representatives of different kingdoms attempt to persuade the outlander chieftain to join their forces. Or a stealthy rogue attempts to sneak unseen past the watch of the town guard. These sorts of situations are called <strong>contested actions</strong>.</p>
<p>To resolve such contests, each character involved makes an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Whoever rolls the highest succeeds at the action. Sometimes, all parties use the same attribute for their action rolls, but often, each character will use a different attribute, as in the case of the rogue attempting to sneak (Agility) past the guard’s watch (Perception).</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="example-contested-action">Example Contested Action</h4>
<p>As the Unnamed Necromancer attempts to open a portal to release a shade demon upon the land, the Uldric the Protector attempts to exert every ounce of his magical will to close the portal. The GM calls for a contested action between the two. The Necromancer makes an Entropy roll and gets a 25, while Uldric gets a 20 on his Protection roll. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, the demon has been unleashed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you will attempt an action under circumstances that give you a significant upper hand, such as when attacking an enemy from behind. Other times, you’ll be working against exceptional hindrances, such as when trying to climb a rope that an enemy has covered in grease. In these types of cases, instead of adjusting the Challenge Rating of the task, the GM should assign your roll either <strong>advantage</strong> or <strong>disadvantage</strong>.</p>
<p>Advantage and disadvantage are always expressed with a numeric level, such as “advantage 1” or “disadvantage 3”. Multiple instances of advantage and disadvantage can add together, so if you have advantage 1 on an attack because you are flanking a foe, and you also possess a feat that grants you advantage 1, you have a total of advantage 2.</p>
<p>If a situation arises in which you are assigned both advantage and disadvantage, find the difference between the two values to determine your final outcome. For example, if you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 1, they negate each other and thus your action roll is normal. If you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 2, your action roll would be made with disadvantage 1.</p>
<h3 id="effects-of-advantage-and-disadvantage">Effects of Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>When you have advantage on an action, roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your advantage level. Then, when adding your dice together, ignore the lowest <em>X</em> attribute dice, in which <em>X</em> is your advantage level.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="example-of-advantage">Example of Advantage</h4>
<p>Vera leaps down upon her foe from a ledge ten feet above. The GM rules that she gains advantage 1 on the attack. Her Might score is 9, granting her 3d10 for attribute dice. The advantage 1 allows her to roll 1 extra d10. So she rolls 1d20 + 4d10. After rolling, but before calculating her total, she removes the lowest rolling d10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disadvantage works in a similar manner. When you have disadvantage, you still roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your disadvantage value. However, instead of ignoring the lowest dice, you ignore the <em>highest</em> dice.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="example-of-disadvantage">Example of Disadvantage</h4>
<p>Therilas attempts to invoke his elemental magic to call a lightning bolt down from a foe. However, he is currently being distracted by a swarm of wasps summoned by an enemy spellcaster, granting him disadvantage 1. Furthermore, he has also been subject to the fatigue bane, adding on an additional disadvantage 1. Therilas’s Energy score is 5, granting him 2d6 attribute dice. He rolls 1d20 + 4d6. After rolling, but before calculating his total, he removes the two highest rolling d6s.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage-are-only-applied-before-explosions">Advantage and Disadvantage Are Only Applied BEFORE Explosions</h3>
<p>Advantage and Disadvantage only apply to your initial pool of dice for an action roll. They do not apply to subsequent rolls granted by exploding dice.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="example-of-advantage-with-exploding-dice">Example of Advantage with Exploding Dice</h4>
<p>Imagine you have attribute score 3 and are rolling with advantage 2, you would roll 1d20 + 3d8 and keep the single highest of the d8s before rolling any exploding dice. Imagine your d20 rolls a 10 and your d8s land on 8, 8, and 3. You would then keep one of the 8s and discard the other two dice. Because the 8 rolled max, you may roll it again and add the result to your total. Imagine that lands on a 5. Your total score is 23 (10 + 8 + 5).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage-with-attribute-scores-of-zero">Advantage and Disadvantage with Attribute Scores of Zero</h3>
<p>When attempting an action with an attribute score of zero you roll 2 d20 and keep the higher die for advantage or the lower die for disadvantage, you cannot accrue advantage or disadvantage greater than 1. Your character is already so inept at the action that they cannot capitalize on cumulative circumstancial help or hindrances.</p>
<h3 id="assigning-advantage-and-disadvantage">Assigning Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Advantage and disadvantage can be assigned by the GM due to situational effects, or they can be assigned by feats, banes, and boons. When assigned situationally, the GM should never apply more than one level of advantage or disadvantage. Feats, banes, and boons–on the other hand–will often provide multiple levels as they rise in tier or power level. The Advantage and Disadvantage Examples Tables provides a listing of typical situations in which the GM may assign advantage and disadvantage, though this list is by no means exhaustive.</p>

<h2 id="legend-points">Legend Points</h2>
<p>An additional layer of depth to action resolution comes in the form of legend points, which allow players an opportunity to stack the dice when it comes time to perform a particularly legendary action.</p>
<p>Characters begin play with zero legend points, and the maximum they may acquire is 10. The GM may reward a PC with a legend point when they use one of their flaws to their own disadvantage or for particularly strong roleplaying (see Chapter 1: Character Creation).</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="example-of-earning-a-legend-point">Example of Earning a Legend Point</h3>
<p>Zaax has the <em>hot tempered</em> flaw, causing him to easily lose control of his anger. In the middle of the party’s tense negotiations with the Imperial Guard, Zaax loses his patience with the high commander and shoots one of the guardsmen. This is a clear example of Zaax roleplaying his flaw despite negative consequences, so the GM awards him with a legend point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GM may also feel free to establish other rules for awarding legend points. For example, some GMs like to allow each player to award another PC one legend point each session. Other tables might have a vote for MVP or best roleplayer at the end of each session, with the winner gaining a legend point.</p>
<h3 id="spending-legend-points">Spending Legend Points</h3>
<p>Before making an action roll, a PC may spend a maximum number of legend points equal to their level plus one. For each legend point spent, they gain advantage 1 on the action roll.</p>
