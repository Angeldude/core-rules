# Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes

The Introduction and Chapter 1 provided you with the core mechanic for action resolution as well as a brief overview of what the different attributes are used for. This chapter will delve a little bit deeper, explaining when to make different types of action rolls and how to interpret the results.

## When to Roll the Dice

Open Legend is about creating great stories full of epic moments of heroism, and you will roll dice to determine the outcome of those moments. In short, you only need to make action rolls when the outcome of the intended action plays a significant role in the story. In combat, for example, you'll be making plenty of action rolls to clash blades, sling spells, shoot blasters, and leap over treacherous chasms. But you don't need to make a Persuasion roll every time you go to buy something from the bazaar, and you don't need to roll Logic to remember where you left your multi-pass.

Open Legend includes a number of extraordinary attributes that can be used to represent futuristic theoretical science, magic, or inherent supernatural capabilities. For all other types of attribute, you can make an action roll with an attribute score of zero, but extraordinary attributes require a minimum score of 1 in order to attempt a roll.

## Every Roll Matters

Another important point in Open Legend is that every action roll should drive the story in a new direction, for better or worse. A failed roll should not let the story stagnate, nor should a failure be easily negated by a successful roll from another character.

If you look back to the Core Mechanic, you can see that a simple failure is not an option:

| The Action Roll  |
| - |
| Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode) |



| If the action roll... | then the result is... |
| :- | :- |
| equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds. |
| is less than the Challenge Rating, | the player succeeds with a twist. <br /> **- OR -** <br /> the player fails, but the story progresses. <br />*(GM's Choice)* |
<div style="margin-top: -50px;"></div>

The following example illustrates how to make every roll matter.

*Pelias Quickenfit, a halfling burglar, is attempting to pick the lock on a door. He makes an Agility roll but gets lower than the challenge rating.*

Here are two potential outcomes for the roll:

*If the GM chooses **success with a twist**, they might rule that Pelias is able to open the lock; however, just as he
finishes the job, he begins to hear a faint hissing sound*

___
*from the door. A poison gas trap! The burglar immediately falls unconscious, and the rest of the party must decide what to do before the gas reaches them in a matter of seconds.*

*If the GM chooses **failure, but the story progresses**, they might rule that although Pelias is unable to get the lock open, he hears footsteps approaching from around the corner accompanied by the familiar jingle of a jailer's keychain. If the party can position themselves quickly enough, they may be able to get the keys without a fight.*

Notice how both of these options allow Pelias's action to drive the story forward just as much as a successful roll would have.


### What NOT To Do

In the above example, what might often happen at a gaming table is that upon seeing the halfling's failure, another character immediately steps forward, say the barbarian, and attempts to force the door down. In Open Legend, such a reaction is frowned upon because it would mean that the burglar's roll didn't matter. It didn't drive the story at all. Instead, the barbarian should wait for the GM to interpret the result of Pelias's roll.  The GM has a right to interpret the results of a failed action roll so that they can ensure that every roll matters. Players should make a special effort to avoid stepping on the GM's toes in this regard.

> ##### Old Habits Die Hard
> If you've played other RPGs in the past, you may be tempted to immediately follow another player's failed roll with an action roll of your own.
>
> The following are common situations in which you should be especially vigilant to give the GM time to interpret the results of a failed action roll:
>
> * Perception rolls to find secret doors or other hidden objects
> * Perception rolls to notice when someone is lying
> * Persuasion rolls to convince an NPC of something
> * Learning rolls to recall useful information

<div style="margin-top: -0.3em;"></div>

### Keep It Simple: Every Roll Matters for the GM

The “every roll matters” rule was designed to make player actions meaningful to the story whether they succeed or fail. It recognizes the fact that static pass / fail rolls aren't particularly fun for players. But “every roll matters” also adds an extra layer of complexity to the game because it requires the GM to make on-the-fly interpretations.

**So when the GM makes a roll**, a success is a success and a failure is a failure. This is for the sake of simplicity and fun. When a player fails a roll, it's not very fun if something doesn't come out of it. When the GM fails a roll, though, there is usually much rejoicing at the table.

<div class="wide" style="height: 1320px;"></div>

## Interpreting Action Rolls

The previous scenario involving Pelias provides just one method in which a GM might interpret the results of an action roll, but there is a little more to it than that. In this section, you'll get some empowering guidelines to help everyone at the table feel comfortable with the amount of improvisation required for Open Legend.

### Interpreting Success

A successful action roll is by far the easiest to interpret: it means that the player gets what they were hoping for. If they were rolling to climb a cliff, then they climb it. If they were trying to pick a pocket, then it's picked. If they were trying to stab an orc, it is stabbed. And so on.

In some cases, the results of a success are already written into the rules (such as in combat, explained in Chapter 7). Often, though, the GM will need to determine what happens with a successful action roll.

There are two primary factors to consider when adjudicating a success:

**Don't roll if there's nothing to succeed at.** For example, if a character wants to search a corridor for secret passages, but the GM knows there aren't any, they don't need to have the character make a Perception roll, because there's nothing to find; the roll doesn't matter.

**Describe your success.** Whenever the situation allows, the player should show the rest of the table what success looks like. It's their turn in the spotlight, so let them shine. If your rogue successfully disarms a trap, describe how the scything blade just barely nicked your cheek before you finished the job. If your mech knight makes a successful leap attack against an enemy tank, narrate how you use the extra momentum provided by the leap to dig your servo-blades through the tank's hull. Sometimes, of course, the GM has privileged information, so they need to be the one to describe things. Whenever possible, though, the players should describe their own success.


```
```

### Interpreting Success with a Twist

When a player fails an action roll, the GM may choose to allow the player's action to succeed with a twist. In this case, the player gets what they wanted originally, but there is some sort of unintended consequence or unexpected cost. The following list is not exhaustive, but it should give you an idea of what qualifies as a twist.

<div style="margin-bottom: -33px"></div>

- **Put a character in danger**
- **Expend a resource**
- **Make an enemy or lose a friend**
- **Overlook an important detail**
- **Waste time**
- **Attract attention**
- **Find something you weren't looking for**

<div style="margin-bottom: -23px"></div>


The important thing to realize is that a success with a twist is still a success. It just comes at some sort of a cost: You find the trail of the hydra you're tracking, but it leads you through a swamp infested with undead. You sense that the merchant is overcharging you, but you fail to realize that he's also distracting you from the thugs sneaking up behind you. You are  able to land a shot against the zombie, but it costs you the last bullet in your magazine.


### Interpreting Failure, but the Story Progresses

In Open Legend, a failure is never just a failure. It's always an important element in the story, hence the wording that “the story progresses”.

Progress, though, can mean a lot of things. When the GM selects this option, the following interpretations should give you some idea of how the story can progress in spite of failure.

**The player finds an opportunity for success.** Even though your magic fails to dispel the curse afflicting your ally, you discover during later study that a rare herb growing in a nearby forest would give you the power you require.

\page

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>

**The danger snowballs.** You fail to jump a chasm while fleeing a band of cannibals and fall along the cliffside, taking some damage. When you gather your senses, you realize that  you aren't only separated from the rest of your party, but you've also fallen into the nest of a Roc.

**The information is false.** You think you've got a good read on the mayor during your negotiations. It seems like she's completely in favor of your plan to negotiate an alliance among the neighboring survivor settlements. When you set out the next day, however, it turns out you were wrong, and the guards the mayor sent to ensure your safe passage turn out to be your assassins.

The GM gets to decide how bad a failed action roll turns out to be, and sometimes, it's really bad. While some of these examples are harsher than others, they all share one common factor: they steer the narrative forward. Failure is never just a failure.

## Determining Challenge Rating

Many actions that you will undertake in *Open Legend* have a Challenge Rating (CR) that is determined by the rules. Attacks in combat, for example, use one of the target's defense scores as the CR.

Oftentimes, though, the GM will need to determine the CR for actions that aren't spelled out clearly in the rules. In these cases, the GM can use the Challenge Ratings by Difficulty Table to set an appropriate CR.


<div style="text-align: center">
##### Challenge Ratings by Difficulty
</div>


| Difficulty | Challenge Rating | Example Actions |
| :-: | :-: | :------ |
| Everyday | 10 | leap a 5' gap, climb a surface with ledges, break down a household door, haggle a simple merchant for a discount |
| Challenging | 15 | climb a rough surface, catch the drift of a text in an unfamiliar language, break down a strong wooden door |
| Heroic | 20 | climb a smooth surface, leap a 15' gap, translate a text in an unfamiliar language, convince a neutral party to take a risk for you |
| Epic | 25 | translate a text in an alien language, break down an iron door |
| Legendary | 30 | leap a 25' chasm, climb a flat surface, befriend an enemy with a vendetta against you |

It's important to note that Challenge Ratings are not typically set to be relative to the party's level. So, breaking down a strong wooden door is CR 15 whether the party is first level or tenth. However, it may be helpful when creating scenarios for GMs to understand the typical capabilities of a character based on their attribute score. The Average Challenge Ratings vs. Attribute Scores Table lists Challenge Ratings that are of average difficulty for a character with specific attribute scores. A character with the listed score can be expected to succeed at the listed Challenge Rating about **50%** of the time.

```
```

<div style="text-align: center">
##### Average Challenge Ratings <br /> vs. Attribute Scores
</div>

| Attribute Score | Average Challenge Rating |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 10 |
| 1 | 12 |
| 2 | 14 |
| 3 | 16 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 20 |
| 6 | 22 |
| 7 | 24 |
| 8 | 26 |
| 9 | 28 |
| 10 | 30 |

### Contested Actions

Sometimes, two or more characters are directly opposing each other in a test of strength, wits, or charm. For example, a mighty barbarian wrestles with a minotaur to get hold of a magical gem. Or three representatives of different star systems attempt to persuade the warleader of the intergalactic reavers to join their forces. Or a stealthy ninja attempts to sneak unseen past the watch of the monks on guard. These sorts of situations are called **contested actions**.

To resolve such contests, each character involved makes an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Whoever rolls the highest succeeds at the action. Sometimes, all parties use the same attribute for their action rolls, but often, each character will use a different attribute, as in the case of the rogue attempting to sneak (Agility) past the guard's watch (Perception).

> ##### Example: Contested Action
>
> As the Unnamed Necromancer attempts to open a portal to release a shade demon upon the land, Uldric the Protector attempts to exert every ounce of his magical will to close the portal. The GM calls for a contested action between the two. The Necromancer makes an Entropy roll and gets a 25, while Uldric gets a 20 on his Protection roll. Unfortunately for the rest of the world, the demon has been unleashed.

### Group Action Rolls

In certain scenarios, the success of an action relies on the skills of multiple characters, such as a party of treasure hunters attempting to sneak past a pair of guards or two hackers working together to access restricted data. In these cases, all characters who are contributing to the task describe what they are doing and make an action roll using an appropriate attribute. Count the number of successes and failures based on the Challenge Rating of the task. If there are more failures than successes, the task fails. Otherwise, the task succeeds. The GM interprets this success or failure

<div class="wide" style="padding-top: 1930px;"></div>

___
as if it were a single action roll, rather than interpreting each action roll separately.

The GM always has the final say as to when a group action roll is called for and, if so, which characters may contribute to the task.

## Advantage & Disadvantage

Sometimes, you will attempt an action under circumstances that give you a significant upper hand, such as when attacking an enemy from behind. Other times, you'll be working against exceptional hindrances, such as when trying to climb a rope that an enemy has covered in grease. In these types of cases, instead of adjusting the Challenge Rating of the task, the GM should assign your roll either **advantage** or **disadvantage**.

Advantage and disadvantage are always expressed with a numeric level, such as “advantage 1” or “disadvantage 3”. Multiple instances of advantage and disadvantage can add together, so if you have advantage 1 on an attack because you are flanking a foe, and you also possess a feat that grants you advantage 1, you have a total of advantage 2.

If a situation arises in which you are assigned both advantage and disadvantage, find the difference between the two values to determine your final outcome. For example, if you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 1, they negate each other and thus your action roll is normal. If you have advantage 1 and disadvantage 2, your action roll would be made with disadvantage 1.

### Effects of Advantage & Disadvantage

When you have advantage on an action, roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your advantage level. Then, when adding your dice together, ignore the lowest *X* attribute dice, in which *X* is your advantage level.

<div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div>

> ##### Example: Advantage
>
> Vera leaps down upon her foe from a ledge ten feet above. The GM rules that she gains advantage 1 on the attack. Her Might score is 9, granting her 3d10 for attribute dice. The advantage 1 allows her to roll 1 extra d10. So she rolls 1d20 + 4d10. The d20 rolls a 16 and the 4d10 roll 3, 5, 7, and 9. She removes the lowest d10 before calculating her total, leaving her with a final roll of 16 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 37.

<div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div>

> ##### Example: Disadvantage
>
> Armand attempts to blast his foe with psychokinetic fire. However, he is currently hindered by a smoke bomb hurled by an enemy soldier, granting him disadvantage 1. Furthermore, he has also been subject to the *fatigued* bane, adding on an additional disadvantage 1. Armand's Energy score is 5, granting him 2d6 attribute dice. He rolls 1d20 + 4d6. After rolling, but before calculating his total, he removes the two *highest* rolling d6s.

\page

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>

Disadvantage works in a similar manner. When you have disadvantage, you still roll an extra number of attribute dice equal to your disadvantage value. However, instead of ignoring the lowest dice, you ignore the *highest* dice.



### Advantage & Disadvantage Are Only Applied BEFORE Explosions

Advantage and Disadvantage only apply to your initial pool of dice for an action roll. They do not apply to subsequent rolls granted by exploding dice.

<div style="padding-bottom: 50px"></div>

> ##### Example: Advantage & Exploding Dice
>
> Tommy "Two Guns" unloads his pistols on a rival gangster. His Agility is 3 and he has advantage 2 on the roll, so he rolls 1d20 + 3d8. Tommy's d20 rolls a 10 and the d8s land 8, 8, and 3. Because of his advantage 2, Tommy ignores the lowest two dice: the 3 and one of the 8s. He re-rolls the remaining 8 because dice explode on their maximum result and gets a 5. His final roll is 23 (10 + 8 + 5).

<div style="padding-bottom: 50px"></div>

### Advantage & Disadvantage without Attribute Dice

When making an action roll without attribute dice, advantage and disadvantage affect the d20. For advantage, roll 2d20 and keep the highest. For disadvantage, roll 2d20 and keep the lowest. Additionally, you cannot accrue advantage or disadvantage greater than 1 in such situations. Your character is already so inept at the action that they cannot capitalize on cumulative circumstantial help or hindrances.

These rules apply to both actions performed with an attribute score of zero, as well as non-action rolls (like the d20 used for a Resist roll). In addition, if you make a roll without attribute dice, you cannot voluntarily incur disadvantage for some beneficial effect. Thus, you cannot multi-target attack if you have an attribute score of zero.


### Assigning Advantage & Disadvantage

Advantage and disadvantage can be assigned by the GM due to situational effects, or they can be assigned by feats, banes, and boons. When assigned situationally, the GM should never apply more than one level of advantage or disadvantage. Feats, banes, and boons—on the other hand—will often provide multiple levels as they rise in tier or power level. The Advantage and Disadvantage Examples Table provides a listing of typical situations in which the GM may assign advantage and disadvantage, though this list is by no means exhaustive.

```
```

<div style="text-align: center">
##### Advantage & Disadvantage Examples
</div>


| Situations Meriting Advantage | Situations Meriting Disadvantage |
| :- | :- |
| Attacking a surprised or unaware foe | Attacking while balancing on a beam |
| Attacking a foe during an acrobatic stunt | Attacking in a confined space |
| Attacking a flanked foe | Attacking while prone |
| Negotiating with someone you have leverage over | Negotiating with someone who has leverage over you |
| Expending a valuable arcane focus when casting a spell | Casting a spell in the midst of a heavy storm |
| Conducting research in a well-stocked library | Conducting research while sick |
| Tracking a large group | Tracking a creature smaller than a child |

## Legend Points

An additional layer of depth to action resolution comes in the form of legend points, which allow players an opportunity to stack the dice when it comes time to perform a particularly legendary action.

Characters begin play with zero legend points, and the maximum they may acquire is 10. The GM may reward a PC with a legend point when they use one of their flaws to their own disadvantage or for particularly strong roleplaying.

<div style="padding-top: 50px;"></div>

> ##### Example: Earning a Legend Point
>
> Zaax has the *hot tempered* flaw, causing him to easily lose control of his anger. In the middle of the party's tense negotiations with the Imperial Guard, Zaax loses his patience with the high commander and shoots one of the guardsmen. This is a clear example of Zaax roleplaying his flaw despite negative consequences, so the GM awards him with a legend point.

<div style="padding-top: 50px;"></div>

The GM may also feel free to establish other rules for awarding legend points. For example, some GMs like to allow each player to award another PC one legend point each session. Other tables might have a vote for MVP or best roleplayer at the end of each session, with the winner gaining a legend point.

### Spending Legend Points

A PC may spend a maximum number of legend points equal to their level plus one in order to enhance a single action roll.

Before making an action roll, the PC declares how many legend points they are spending, and gains advantage 1 on the roll for each legend point spent. Additionally, for each legend point spent on the roll a +1 is added to the end result.


\page

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>


## Attributes and <br>Action Rolls in Play

As previously explained, whenever you need to determine the outcome of a meaningful task, you make an action roll using an attribute appropriate to the task. Sometimes, the results of your roll will be very clearly spelled out in the rules, such as when making attacks or invoking banes and boons. Oftentimes, though, you'll want to attempt an action that isn't spelled out explicitly in the rules. In this section, you'll find examples of the sorts of actions you can accomplish with every attribute, as well as some suggested interpretations of “success with a twist” and “failure, but the story progresses” for those times when the dice just don't go your way.

For each attribute, we offer examples of actions classified at three levels based on difficulty and extent of impact on the narrative:

**Challenging (CR 15):** Success at the task indicates overcoming a minor challenge or altering the narrative in a way that isn't disruptive.

**Heroic (CR 20):** Success at the task indicates overcoming a major challenge or altering the narrative in a mildly disruptive way.

**Epic (CR 25):** Success at the task indicates overcoming a near impossible challenge or altering the narrative in a very disruptive way.

### Might

Might is the attribute of brute strength and physical power. Your Might score represents your ability to actively overpower your foes and your environment through sheer muscle.

#### Challenging Test of Might (CR 15)

In the midst of combat, a small boulder proves to be a nuisance for maneuvering into tactical positions, so Rogar employs his mighty thews to shove it 10 feet out of the way.

**Success with a twist:** Rogar manages to move the boulder. However, he pulls a muscle and suffers the *slowed* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Rogar is so focused on moving the boulder that he fails to notice the pair of goblins that have now flanked him.

#### Heroic Test of Might (CR 20)

While fighting atop a raft amid a surging river, Lily is knocked into the rapids. She attempts to fight the current and swim back to the raft before being swept away from her allies.

**Success with a twist:** Lily makes it back to the raft safely, but the only way she is able to swim well enough is to drop her blade and shield into the river.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** In her vain attempt to swim against the rapids, Lily is knocked unconscious when she hits her head on a rocky outcropping. Her allies see this happen, and must act fast to save her from drowning.

```
```

#### Epic Test of Might (CR 25)

While his party is busy strategizing about back doors, secret passages, and disguises to gain entrance to the Iron Fortress, Krund steps up to the iron portcullis and girds his loins for a deadlift of epic proportions.

**Success with a twist:** Krund lifts the gate, and several members of his party get through. However, his strength gives way before they all escape, and now the party is divided.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Despite all his might and main, Krund cannot lift the gate more than a foot. When he releases it, the loud clang alerts several guards within.

### Agility

Agility is a measure of your character's dexterity, nimbleness, motor skills, and reaction time. It governs tasks such as remaining unseen, swinging from chandeliers, maneuvering in a dogfight, and picking a lock.

#### Challenging Test of Agility (CR 15)

As Terri chases Gizmo the Gnomtorious bounty hunter through the narrow corridors of the space station, her quarry releases his patented Slip Slime Bomb, covering the ground between them with a slippery greenish grease. Terri attempts to slide nimbly through the slime instead of letting it slow her down.

**Success with a twist:** Terri glides gracefully across the grease, but fails to notice the broken exhaust pipe hanging from the ceiling until the last minute. She manages to dodge the pipe only by grabbing hold of it and swinging around it, which forces her to drop her shotgun. If she's going to keep up with Gizmo, she'll have to do it unarmed.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** With all the grace and agility of a drunken elephant, Terri falls on her face in a pile of green goo. By the time she struggles to the other edge of the slime, Gizmo is nowhere in sight, and she'll have to think fast to decide which direction to take at the T-intersection up ahead if she doesn't want to lose her quarry.

#### Heroic Test of Agility (CR 20)

Jax is piloting his Starfighter in a high speed dogfight against a pair of Dalturian Destroyers. They're both on his tail, and if he doesn't shake them soon, they'll have locked on their homing missiles. Jax slams the throttle forward and attempts to speed through a narrow canyon up ahead.

**Success with a twist:** Jax zooms through the rocky terrain at breakneck speed. When he comes out the other end, he has managed to lose one of the Dalturians, but the second is still hot on his trail.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Jax zooms between two pillars of raw earth, and misjudges their width by a few inches. He hears a metallic crack as one of his wings is mangled beyond function and Jax crash lands. Shattering the glass hull, he manages to escape with his life, but his flier isn't going anywhere.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>


#### Epic Test of Agility (CR 25)

Winston, renowned as the finest archer in the land, has been captured by the giant lord Glorrg. Glorrg demands that Winston proves he really is who he says he is. The giant has one of his servants release four hummingbirds in the air and demands Winston to shoot them all down before they can escape.

**Success with a twist:** In his signature style, Winston knocks 4 arrows at once and lets them fly. All four birds fall to the ground. However, the archer was not completely aware of his surroundings, and one of the arrows skewers one of Glorrg's servants, sending the giant lord into a fit of rage.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Winston fires arrow after arrow, but he can only manage to fell three of the birds. Glorrg is not impressed, and he orders the archer to be stripped of his bow and thrown into the Pit of Beasts.

### Fortitude

Fortitude governs your ability to withstand physical punishment. Tests of Fortitude include fighting off disease, surviving malnourishment, and marching long stretches without rest. In most cases, you'll be making Fortitude rolls at the GM's prompting in response to a situation, rather than actively choosing to make a roll.

#### Challenging Test of Fortitude (CR 15)

Sheriff Bates and his posse of deputies are tracking a pair of bandits through the desert. In an effort to make up for lost time, they attempt to double march despite the blazing heat. The GM calls for a Fortitude roll to resist the harsh cruelties of the desert.

**Success with a twist:** Those who fail their roll are able to keep up with the rest of the crew, but they suffer one level of the *fatigued* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Everyone who fails simply cannot keep up. If they don't rest, they will assuredly pass out. The posse must make a tough decision: make camp and risk the bandits escaping, or split up the party to let the hardier members cover ground.

#### Heroic Test of Fortitude (CR 20)

While traversing the deep reaches of space, Zak was unfortunately infected with the Chronos Plague - a debilitating disease that distorts the infected's perception of space-time. He lies in the Rebel HQ sick bay, struggling to fight off the illness, and makes a Fortitude roll to determine how well he recovers.

**Success with a twist:** After a day or two of rest, Zak makes a full recovery and is now immune. However, unbeknownst to him, he has become a carrier of the pathogen, endangering his unwary allies.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Zak's immune system is too compromised, and the disease persists. However, while Zak was confined to the sick bay, his ally Dr. Vreck was hard at work researching a potential cure. Vreck has learned of a rare sub thermal lichen that grows only on the asteroids of the Alpha System. This lichen may hold the secret to reversing the disease.

```
```

#### Epic Test of Fortitude (CR 25)

A party of legendary heroes has followed the Shadow Demon Yrrllx to his native home on the entropic plane. Every moment within this realm of shade and chaos bites away at the very existence of the heroes, and the GM calls for Fortitude rolls to determine how the party weathers the destructive forces of this foreign plane.

**Success with a twist:** The hero is able to keep his very existence from unraveling. However, upon returning to the material world, he will be forever changed, as some part of his reality was lost to the place of shadows.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The hero succumbs to forces of entropy that enshroud this plane, and his material body fades from existence. He may travel the entropic plane freely. However, he cannot return to the material plane until he finds a way to restore his bodily shell.

### Learning

Learning is the attribute of raw knowledge, memory, and the ability to apply the right facts in the right situation. You make a Learning roll whenever you attempt to recall important information, make sense of conflicting details, or assimilate unfamiliar knowledge into your own context. An important note about Learning is that it represents both the knowledge that you are familiar with and also your ability to gain new knowledge quickly. So, a foreigner in a strange land wouldn't be able to recall facts about local history just because they have a high Learning score. However, their high Learning score would be of use when it comes to quickly assimilating the lore of the new environment.

#### Challenging Test of Learning (CR 15)

Gregory, student of the arcane arts, is travelling with his companions through the Tomb of Sharakandra when they come upon an open doorway carved with eldritch runes. Gregory attempts to decipher the runes based on his past studies.

**Success with a twist:** Gregory successfully identifies the runes as a protective ward. However, to do so, he must spend nearly an hour sifting through the tomes of lore that he carries with him.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** While attempting to decipher the runes, Gregory traces his fingers across one of them, immediately activating a trap. He is struck with a bolt of lightning and a loud thunderclap alerts the entire tomb of the interlopers.

#### Heroic Test of Learning (CR 20)

While traversing the jungle planet Thox, Selena encounters a race of alien squid men who speak in a series of gurgles and hisses. Though their language is foreign, she is well practiced in a number of alien languages, and so she attempts to comprehend theirs as well.

**Success with a twist:** Selena can understand the squid language well enough to gather a general impression of what they are trying to communicate, though complex ideas are impossible to transmit.

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>

**Failure, but the story progresses:** In her attempt to learn the language, Selena mimics several of the gurgles and hisses of the squid men. They take her mimicry as an insult, and they are on the verge of taking her prisoner if she cannot find a way to make peace.

#### Epic Test of Learning (CR 25)

Belmont the Bard is attempting to negotiate peace between two gnoll tribes that have been feuding for nearly a century. Searching the depth and breadth of his bardic lore, Belmont attempts to recall some sort of historical fact about the feud that could give him leverage in the negotiation.

**Success with a twist:** Although Belmont cannot come up with anything to help him immediately, he does remember hearing a story of a gnoll witch named Yaga Balbassa who is said to have lived for 200 years in the marsh at the center of the realm. She would likely have memory of how the feud began.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Belmont falls short in his bardic lore, and the gnoll chief has no more patience for the unwelcome meddling of an outsider. He immediately orders another raid on the enemy.

### Logic

Logic is the mental attribute of deductive reasoning and problem solving. Characters who are skilled in Logic might be riddle masters, expert programmers, military geniuses, uncanny sleuths, or ingenious trap smiths. The GM will call for a Logic roll when you attempt to decipher a mystery, predict an opponent's behavior, or devise a foolproof plan.


#### Challenging Test of Logic (CR 15)

Commander Grimm's sky ship, *The Danger*,  is under attack by a half dozen enemy gliders. The gliders can turn on a dime and easily outmaneuver the powerful gatling guns mounted at the bow the *Danger*. Grimm takes a moment to analyze their attack formation and predict the gliders' most probable movements in hopes of catching as many of them as possible at the front of his ship during the next run.

**Success with a twist:** Grimm's experience pays off, and he is able to issue his crew commands to catch three of the gliders within range of the gatling guns. However, the turn leaves him in vulnerable position to the other three gliders, who receive advantage on their attacks this round.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Grimm thinks he's got the gliders right where he wants them, but his crew is slow to take orders, and the gliders manage to completely avoid the gatling guns this round.

#### Heroic Test of Logic (CR 20)

Cyril the android is stranded in Junkland, a miles long island of debris that floats in the ocean outside of New L.A. Cyril's core battery has been severely damaged, making his CPU process at half speed. The android scavenges through the hills of Junkland for enough spare parts to jerry-rig a temporary repair.

**Success with a twist:** Cyril finds what he needs to repair his battery, but the materials are unstable. The GM rules that until Cyril can find appropriate materials, he will suffer the *stunned* bane every time he rolls a 5 or less on the d20 for an action roll.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Cyril can't find anything salvageable from the junk heaps nearby. What he does manage to stir up, however, are a pair of Techno

___
Pack Rats who eye his circuitry and armored plating with much envy.


#### Epic Test of Logic (CR 25)

Azure and party are attempting to negotiate with the Dragon Council in order to convince the wyrms to break their vow of neutrality and aid the races of good in the Demon War. Things are looking grim, but Azure is well-studied in the Dragon Code, and he attempts to find a loophole around the Council's insistence that the Law of Gold requires that any dragon who serves the lower races must be paid its weight in gold for the service. The legalistic wyrms insist that even if any of their kin were willing to fight along the humanoids out of the goodness of their hearts, the Law of Gold would still need to be satisfied.

**Success with a twist:** Azure notes to the Council that if the payment were to take place on the plane of Chaos, where weights and measures shift unpredictably, then the humanoids could readily provide enough gold to satisfy the law provided the exchange occur at the proper moment. Although much of the Council is dissatisfied with this proposition, they bring it to a vote and favor falls on Azure's

___
side. However, for the inconvenience of interdimensional travel, the Council rules that every wyrm employed must also be compensated with a magical artifact of acceptable power.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Azure fails to come up with a reasonable loophole, and the Council rules that any wyrm who aids in the Demon Wars without the Law of Gold being satisfied will be deemed an outcast of dragonkind.

### Perception

Perception governs your ability notice important details in people, places, and things. You roll Perception when you are trying to find a secret passage, follow a trail, sense ulterior motives, or spot a hidden foe. For Perception rolls especially, it's important to remember that *every roll matters*. The GM should only ask for a Perception roll when there is actually something to be perceived. Furthermore, the GM should ask for the roll only at the moment when the outcome matters. So, if a rogue enters a dungeon and declares that he will be searching for traps in every room, the player should not actually roll until he might actually discover a trap. That way, the outcome of the roll will actually matter and the game won't be slowed down by unnecessary dice rolling.

#### Challenging Test of Perception (DC 15)

Yldris is interrogating a captured goblin to learn more about the threats of the goblin lair. The captive reveals the location of several pit traps as well as two guard outposts. However, he is holding something back, so the GM asks Yldris to make a Perception roll. If successful, Yldris would sense that the goblin is holding out on him out of fear of reprisal from the goblin king.

**Success with a twist:** Yldris can tell that the goblin is keeping something secret, but he thinks it is out of greed rather than fear.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Yldris falsely senses that the goblin is about to attempt an escape.

#### Heroic Test of Perception (DC 20)

Zak and his party are exploring the remnants of an abandoned space colony. Several signs suggest that something new has taken up residence in the colony, so Zak tells the
GM that he will be
searching for traps ahead of the party.
After clearing several rooms, the party is
walking down a corridor that the GM knows to contain a proximity mine, so she asks Zak to roll Perception.

**Success with a twist:** Zak notices the mine just as he steps within its activation zone. He's able to warn his party, but he takes the full blast impact from the mine.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Zak sets off the trap, and the explosion collapses part of the chamber, separating him from his party.

#### Epic Test of Perception (DC 25)

Therilas attempts to track a pixie through the Fey Wood. The trail is two days old, and because the pixie flies, his only hope is to search for occasional drifts of pixie dust settled on leaves and branches.

**Success with a twist:** Therilas loses the trail a mile into the woods. As he searches about in frustration, he is approached by a sentient fox who offers to reveal the location of the pixie—for a price.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Therilas wanders for hours in the Fey Wood trying to pick up the trail. Finally, he  finds it, though it seems oddly fresh. Too late does he realize that he has been tricked—the pixie has led him into a trap. He finds himself surrounded by denizens of the Fey Wood and hears the pixie's mischievous laughter from the canopy above.

### Will

Will is the attribute of mental fortitude and willpower. It represents your character's ability to fight back against threats to their sanity, bravery, or focus. While your Will often plays a passive role by contributing to your Resolve defense score, you will also make active tests with this attribute when you are calling solely on your willpower to overcome a mental threat or directly pitting your Will against an outside force, as in the following examples.

#### Challenging Test of Will (CR 15)

Setting Sun and his companions are lost in the desert. They've been without food and water for 2 days, and the GM asks what each of them are doing to stave off the negative effects of dehydration and starvation. While the monk's allies call upon their Fortitude to grit their teeth through the pain or their Alteration magic to bolster their bodies, Setting Sun

___

retreats into the calm of his meditative mind, relying on his Will to  get him through the trial.

**Success with a twist:** The monk's meditation works to an extent. He is only able to stave off his hunger, but not his thirst, so he suffers one level of the *fatigued* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Setting Sun's training was good, but the calm of the monastery is hard to recall amidst his current struggles. Overcome with hunger and thirst, the monk suffers 2 levels of the *fatigued* bane.


#### Heroic Test of Will (CR 20)

Deep in the lower chambers of Overhill Asylum, the investigators discover an ancient and alien evil whose very existence in the physical dimension seems an impossibility. Unable to reconcile their understanding of the laws of nature with the creature's writhing form and material instability, the PCs begin to lose touch with reality. The GM calls for each investigator to make a Will roll.

**Success with a twist:** The PCs are overcome with an uncontrollable but temporary horror. While they remain in the Asylum, they suffer a special form of the *demoralized* bane (Power Level 3). It cannot be resisted until they leave the Asylum.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** In addition to suffering the *demoralized* bane, the PCs gain the *psychotic* flaw until they find some means of re-orienting their understanding of the universe and its laws.

#### Epic Test of Will (CR 25)

While jacked deep into the Network, Snitch encounters a data file that has been encrypted by Prime, who is said to be the first Jacker to find a way to enter the Network. Prime detects the intrusion, but the overzealous Snitch chooses to go head to head with the legend rather than jack out. Snitch puts the full power of his Will against Prime in hopes of breaking through his firewall.

**Success with a twist:** Snitch actually manages to find a way to break through Prime's guard and access some of his data. However, the oldest Jacker in the Network is no pushover. During the battle of wits he discovers a leak in Snitch's security systems. When Snitch jacks out, he

___
discovers that his bank account has been emptied of every single credit he owned.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Snitch's Will is no match for the first Jacker. Prime protects his data and ejects Snitch from the Network.

### Deception

Deception is the attribute of fooling others, both directly and indirectly. You make a Deception roll whenever you attempt to bluff, lie, socially dodge, or otherwise convince someone else that false information is true. Deceptive characters can fool interrogators, create believable disguises, and pass off fake documents.

#### Challenging Test of Deception (CR 15)

Slade has acquired an appropriate disguise to pass as a city guard. As he attempts to gain access to the armory, the GM calls for a Deception roll to determine if he can act naturally enough to avoid arousing suspicion from other guards.

**Success with a twist:** Slade does really well at keeping up his disguise, but he fails to address a superior officer appropriately at one point. Although he will gain access to the armory, this officer remembers the altercation and will be able to identify Slade at a later time if suspicion is ever raised.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Slade's military etiquette faux pas is worse than expected. The offended officer immediately requests to know Slade's commanding officer so that he can report the offense.


#### Heroic Test of Deception (CR 20)

Adele scans her multi-pass to gain entry to a level 5 sector of her office building, even though she only has clearance up to level 4. When the security sentry on duty questions her, Adele spins a tale about how she's been having trouble with her multi-pass all day ever since she got caught in a mag storm on the way to work and that she's just trying to get back into her office to grab her lunch.


**Success with a twist:** The sentry believes the story, but just to cover his butt he has to escort her to the office so that he doesn't get in trouble.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The sentry is suspicious and tells Adele that he will need to contact his shift commander about this.


#### Epic Test of Deception (CR 25)

The chronomancer Rapture has Sarge and his crew tied up as he prepares to unleash his dreaded Time Cannon upon the unsuspecting moon colony below. To power this attack, Rapture loads the Void Crystal, which he has recently stolen back from the heroes. In a final attempt to buy some time, Sarge lies through the skin of his teeth: “Too bad for you, Rapture, ‘cause we switched out the crystal back on Alpha Prime. I can't wait to see what happens to your precious Time Cannon when you try to fire it with that ringer locked and loaded. With any luck, it will blow this whole ship to space dust.”

**Success with a twist:** Rapture is convinced enough to power down the cannon before it can finish charging, thus buying the heroes a little more time. In a fit of rage,

though, he orders one of his lieutenants to slit Sarge's throat, immediately applying the *death* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Rapture calls Sarge's bluff and immediately gives the command to fire.

### Persuasion

Persuasion is the social attribute of negotiation and smooth talking. You make a Persuasion roll whenever you are trying to convince someone to see your way or take your suggested course of action based on a clear or clever argument. Persuasion is about selling your ideas to others, whether that be through the use of solid evidence, emotional appeal, political pressure, bribery, or similar mechanisms. A Persuasion roll often takes place as the result of a good deal of dialog and other roleplaying. In these cases, the GM should not ask for a roll until a pivotal decision point is reached—a moment when the success or failure of the roll will determine the course of the negotiation.

```
```

#### Challenging Test of Persuasion (CR 15)

Pelias is trying to trade a valuable ruby to the barkeep in exchange for the names of three gentlemen who were drinking at the tavern last night. The barkeep says he'll give the rogue one name, so Pelias tries to convince him of the value of this gem in order to get all the info he needs.

**Success with a twist:** The barkeep offers to give him two names. If the rogue wants all three, he'll have to throw in a sack of gold.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** It's clear that the barkeep is worried about more than just money. The rogue's entreaties have spooked him completely and he won't even give up a single name anymore.



#### Heroic Test of Persuasion (CR 20)

When they reach the town of Haven, the survivors find the gates closed. The guards inform them that the Overseer has placed a blockade on all outsiders due to reports of an outbreak of a new strain of Virus Z. With a few smooth words,  Wendell manages to get the Overseer to come to the gate, but now he is attempting the much




\page

<div class='footnote'>CHAPTER 2: ACTIONS & ATTRIBUTES</div>

more difficult task of convincing him that his group isn't infected and that they would be a valuable asset to the town.

**Success with a twist:** The Overseer finds the group's deeds impressive and believes their story. However, he will accept them into Haven only if they agree to a one week quarantine, which will significantly delay their agenda.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The Overseer doesn't care how valuable the group might be to his town, he simply cannot put his people at risk of another outbreak. He orders them away, and commands his guards to shoot them on sight if they return.

#### Epic Test of Persuasion (CR 25)

Professor Durst and his team of investigators have managed to take one of the cultists of the Black Claw alive. The cultists are known to be diehard loyalists who will take the secrets of their guild to the grave, but Durst is well versed in the arts of psychological interrogation. He uses every mental tool at his disposal to get the cultist to see the error of his ways and aid their cause.

**Success with a twist:** Durst has managed to leverage the cultist's deeply suppressed emotions of guilt to get him to denounce the Black Claw. However, the terror of the dark deeds he has taken part in cannot be reconciled with the cultist's former self, driving him insane. The cultist might provide some useful information to the investigators, but it is always hidden between maniacal ramblings and diabolical riddles.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Durst thinks he has
broken the cultist, and unties him as a show of goodwill. However, as soon as the cultist has the chance, he jumps through a nearby window and breaks his own neck in the fall.

### Presence

Presence is the social attribute of leadership and charisma. A character with a high Presence will be able to attract powerful allies, inspire followers, and strike fear in the hearts of enemies. You will make a Presence roll whenever you are attempting to sway others with your force of personality, such as when making speeches, singing ballads, or staring down a foe.

#### Challenging Test of Presence (CR 15)

Shazben Hazben, the halfling bard, enters the tavern with a well-tuned mandolin but not even two coppers to scrape together. After striking up a conversation with the barkeep, Shazben offers to entertain the guests in exchange for room  and board. The bartender likes the halfling's style, so he gives him a chance to win him over on stage that night.

**Success with a twist:** The crowd loves the halfling, even bringing in a few silver for tips. However, the greedy barkeep says the bard can stay as long as he gets a cut of half the tips.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Shazben gets booed off the stage after inadvertently insulting a local folk hero in song. He is no longer welcome at the tavern.

```
```

#### Heroic Test of Presence (CR 20)

Gunner Dag has gotten himself into another one of his situations. He lost big at poker with a few of the local miners, used a bit of harsh language about one of their mother's, and now he finds himself standing on main street at high noon, his Volt Pistol hanging at his hip and his eyes glaring at another stranger that he really doesn't want to kill. He grits his teeth, hardens his eyes, and calls on every nerve of steel he has to overawe this yokel into backing down before things get bloody.

**Success with a twist:** The miner can see in Dag's eyes that he is a born killer. He throws down his gun, but he still wants revenge. He will catch Dag in an alley later with many more thugs if he can.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Dag's hard eyes spook the miner into drawing his gun. Now the gunner has to decide if he's going to kill the local or try to find another way out of this.

#### Epic Test of Presence (CR 25)

The peasant militia is poorly trained, under armed, and small in number. Their odds are hopeless. Still, Maximus knows that the distraction they can provide against the advancing orcish army is the only way that his elite strike force will have the time to reach the shaman commanding the orcs—but only if they stand and fight. The paladin can read the cowardice on their faces, so he gives a long, rousing speech to lift their hearts and instill them with courage they need to get the job done.

**Success with a twist:** Unfortunately for Maximus, the cowardly mayor is working against him. He has already convinced half of the militia to retreat with him and leave the village for the orcs to sack. The remaining half, however, are ready to die for their home alongside the paladin if need be.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Maximus doesn't have what it takes to sway the hearts of such hopeless soldiers in so hopeless a cause. The militia disbands, and the village is surely lost to the orcs.


### Alteration

Alteration is the attribute of changing matter from one form to another. It can be used to animate tree roots, carve statuary from boulders, shapeshift into a dragon, and transmute flesh to stone.

#### Challenging Test of Alteration (CR 15)

Svyll needs to reach the top of a short cliff, but he hasn't the skill in climbing to manage. He is one with the earth, though, so he attempts to mold the cliff face temporarily to create a sort of stone ladder upon which he can ascend.

**Success with a twist:** Svyll's magic doesn't fail him, but it doesn't work as efficiently as expected and his climb takes twice as long as it should have.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Svyll fails to take into account the delicate nature of the cliff, causing a small landslide to fall upon his party. However, when they pick themselves out of the rubble, they discover that the landslide revealed a cavern opening that was previously concealed.

#### Heroic Test of Alteration (CR 20)

Wrench and his squad are being pursued through the corridors of a wrecked space station by a horde of cannibalistic mutants. While the mutants are temporarily delayed breaking down one of the blast doors, Wrench attempts to animate the electronic gizmos in the room to slow down the horde and buy the group enough time to get back to their ship.

**Success with a twist**: It looks like it's going to take Wrench a little longer to spring his trap than he thought. The GM says that the rest of his party will have to fend off the mutants for five rounds to buy Wrench enough time, forcing them to make a tough decision.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The spare parts in the room just aren't good enough to work with. However, Wrench does discover a ventilation shaft in the ceiling that could provide an alternate means of escape—if the mutants don't already know about it.

#### Epic Test of Alteration (CR 25)

Artemis isn't going to let a little thing like a thrice-locked stone door keep him from the king's vault. With arcane words and gestures, he attempts to dig a hole right through the door.

**Success with a twist:** Artemis doesn't have the power to burrow through the wall. It seems that some arcane magic protects the stone. However, he is able to use his magic to disable one of the three locks.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Before Artemis's magic can work its wonders on the stone, a magical trap springs and zaps the wizard, draining some of his hit points and leaving him unable to get past the door.

### Creation

Creation is the attribute of healing and forming matter out of nothing. It can be used to close wounds, summon creatures out of thin air, and even raise the dead. Creation is also a tool for channeling higher powers, and thus it can be used to empower allies with divine might, inspiration, or similar effects.

#### Challenging Test of Creation (CR 15)

Jaaxy is trying to gain entrance into the headquarters of the Order of Outlanders, but she lacks an appropriate keystone attuned to her biometrics required by the door guards. Having studied the shattered remains of a keystone acquired from a previous member of the Order, Jaaxy sits in her lab attempting to create a new one.

**Success with a twist:** Jaaxy's keystone is good enough to get her through the door. However, it loses its biometric attunement shortly after she enters the headquarters.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Jaaxy thinks her creation is perfect, but the door guards aren't fooled so easily. They identify the forgery and imprison her. She's within the headquarters now, just not on her own terms.


#### Heroic Test of Creation (CR 20)

Therilas is attempting to lead a party of refugees safely through the Decaying Desert. Were he in the woods, the druid could easily forage enough food and water to keep them alive. Lost in the desert, however, he is forced to

___
use his magic to summon forth sustenance for the desperate masses.


**Success with a twist:** The only way that Therilas is able to harness enough energy to feed so many people is to draw on his own life reserves. The GM rules that he suffers one level of the *fatigued* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Unfortunately, despite his best efforts, Therilas can only create half of the food and water that it would take to adequately sustain the refugees. Half of them won't survive the journey without further intervention.



#### Epic Test of Creation (CR 25)

Father Ezekiel is stranded on a jungle island. He attempts to use divine magic to create a massive airship out of nothing so that he and his companions can escape.

**Success with a twist:** The GM rules that Father's magic will only be strong enough to create the airship if he can find a magical focus of appropriate power somewhere within the island.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Father thinks he has crafted a skyworthy vessel. However, shortly after taking to the sky, the magic binding the ship  unweaves, the party must think fast as the ship begins to plummet to the ground below.

### Energy

Energy is the extraordinary attribute that governs the control and creation of elemental energy. Though the list is not exhaustive, typical energy types include fire, ice, electricity, water, earth, acid, plasma, and lasers. You could be called upon to make an Energy roll when you attempt to create flame out of nothing, calm rough waters at sea, or power up a futuristic plasma cannon beyond the normal range of technology for your setting. A character's energy score governs their skill at manipulating all forms of energy, though the character must have a logical explanation for individual uses of this attribute. For example, a storm mage could use energy for manipulating electricity, thunder, water, and wind - but the GM might not allow him to summon ice and fire.

#### Challenging Test of Energy (CR 15)

Asger and Hertha have trekked long and hard through the frozen Fjords of the Titans, and as night falls they manage to take shelter in a cave before the midnight winds drop the temperature to deadly levels. Still, the cave is cold, and though Asger starts a meager fire to keep them warm, Hertha attempts to use her fire magic to maintain and multiply the heat to ward off hypothermia.

**Success with a twist:** Hertha's spell works, though the cold is stronger than she realized. In order to maintain the magic throughout the night, she must sacrifice a component of minor value to empower her charm. With the GM's approval, Hertha decides to melt down her golden bracelet to power the spell.


**Failure, but the story progresses:** Asger's fire is enough to keep them from freezing to death, but without Hertha's magic, they are still quite frostbitten and exhausted by the morning. Both PCs suffer one level of the *fatigued* bane.

#### Heroic Test of Energy (CR 20)

Doctor Heller accompanies his posse in raiding a train that is transporting a large sum of Pinkerton cash. They've neutralized the guards and taken control of the train, but they still have to get the safe open. Doc powers up his patented Slow Drip Acidic Disseminator and attempts to burn through the lock with expert precision.

**Success with a twist:** Doc's mad science works a bit too well as the Disseminator overloads and burns through the entire door of the safe, destroying about one-fifth of the score along with it.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** It turns out the safe has been coated with a corrosion proof chemical that renders Doc's acid harmless. The good news is that Doc is smart enough to recognize this. The bad news is that it takes him so  long to figure it out that the Pinkerton reinforcements have arrived on horseback.



#### Epic Test of Energy (CR 25)

Hamlin Harbuckle sits peacefully on the deck of *The Rest*, a merchant vessel his party has been hired to protect. The ship tosses and turns as a typhoon rains down lightning and thunder. As crew members hoist ropes and batten hatches, the quiet halfling Storm Caller opens wide his white eyes. His hair stands on end as he attempts to take control of the storm and calm the seas.

**Success with a twist:** As Hamlin wrestles with the power of the typhoon, he soon realizes that the only way to control its power is to absorb it. To save his friends and wards, Hamlin channels all the power of the storm into a single lightning bolt that strikes him unconscious and half dead.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Hamlin attempts to settle the waves and the wind to no avail. A massive lightning bolt sunders the mast to pieces.

### Entropy

Entropy is the extraordinary attribute of destruction, death, and negative energy. It is the stuff of necromancers and anti-matter rays, ghosts and demons. You would make an Entropy roll in order to destroy solid matter, complete a dark ritual, or close a portal to a plane of evil or shadow.

#### Challenging Test of Entropy (CR 15)

Gizmo is attempting to bypass a lock on a mundane door using his Pocket Matter Disintegration Device. He focuses the beam on the lock and rolls to remove it from existence.

**Success with a twist:** Gizmo's device works, but overheats in the process due to the volatile nature of his mad science. He can't use it again until he has the time and equipment to make repairs.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The device overheats before it can get fully powered up and explodes in Gizmo's face. He suffers the *blinded* bane, and the loud noise alerts the guards down the hallway.

#### Heroic Test of Entropy (CR 20)

Balthazar has delved deep into the Tomb of Aliki to gain access to the powerful death magics rumored to be buried within. The necromancer encounters the shade

___
of Aliki himself, who demands that Balthazar prove his power over the things of the night or face his own destruction. Balthazar channels his necromantic magic to manipulate the shadows in the chamber, shaping and moving them about to his desire.

**Success with a twist:** The spell works, though the ghost is unimpressed. Aliki animates the shadows to attack the necromancer, stating that Balthazar can prove his worthiness by defeating the shadows.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Balthazar's spell fails, and the shadows do not bend to his will. With a maniacal laugh, Aliki attacks the necromancer, attempting to inflict the *death* bane.

#### Epic Test of Entropy (CR 25)

Xu Ming and his team of survivors have journeyed in their starcruiser to an abandoned sector of the galaxy emitting a strange energy signature. Touching down on the surface, they discover hordes of nightmarish aliens pouring through a  massive portal. As the rest of the team mows down the advancing horde, the voidtouched psion Stryx attempts to channel void energy from a higher dimension to nullify the portal.

**Success with a twist:** Stryx must contend with a horrifying alien brood master holding the portal open and preparing to make the jump itself. It uses all of its mind-warping power to twist her mind and break her. She prevails and manages to close the portal, though the mental battle scars her for life. She suffers a permanent level of the *fatigued* bane until she can find a means to cure herself.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Although she doesn't have the power to close the portal, Stryx realizes that it is being held open by an alien brood master on the other side. If her team dares to enter the portal and slay the creature, the portal should close.

### Influence

Influence is used to cover such extraordinary powers as turning invisible, controlling minds, and creating illusory phantasms to deceive others. Any time you are using extraordinary means to affect what another creature perceives or to exert mental control over them, you will likely be making an Influence roll. Influence differs from the attributes Presence, Deception, and Persuasion in that it is used for extreme or supernatural effects. Whereas Persuasion might be used to convince a creature to agree with you by using a strong argument and evidence, Influence would be used to accomplish the same effect using mental charm or domination.




#### Challenging Test of Influence (CR 15)

Ensign Destiny attempts to convince the bouncer at the cantina that her friends should be allowed to leave peacefully. To stack the deck against the bouncer, Destiny activates the Pheromone Enhancement Matrix on her cyberwear to cloud his judgement.


**Success with a twist:** The trick works, but her cyberwear has obviously been miscalibrated. Rather than simply convinced, the bouncer has been seduced. He is under the distinct impression that Destiny is hitting on him.

Shipwrecked on a remote jungle island, Allister and his companions find themselves surrounded by a horde of tiny tribal lizard men out for blood. With a grand show of illusory lights, Allister attempts to use his magic to convince the lizards that he was sent from the stars to command them.

**Success with a twist:** The lizards are convinced of Allister's god-like nature, but they still do not trust his companions, treating them as mere slaves of a god.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** A shaman among the lizardfolk recognizes Allister's illusions and calls him out on them. The lizards, inflamed with rage at the deception, launch an attack.

#### Epic Test of Influence (CR 25)

The only thing that stands between Sir Thomas and the Sword of Light is an undead skeletal dragon named Char. Char engages the paladin in a test of words, attempting to use his wyrm speak to ensorcell Thomas. Never one for words, Sir Thomas relies instead on his divine magic, channeling the power of his goddess to strike fear in Char's undead heart and make him quit his word games.

**Success with a twist:** Sir Thomas's prayer is heard, though Char's power is greater than the paladin realized. The dragon fails to completely ensorcell Thomas, but when the fight breaks out, the paladin begins with the *stunned* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Sir Thomas is far from his god in this dank pit and cannot channel enough divine power to overcome the dragon's wyrm tongue. Before he realizes what he has done, the paladin has revealed his deepest secrets to the ancient beast. Thomas begins the fight with the *stunned* bane and Char gains advantage 1 on every action roll throughout the combat due to his deep knowledge of the paladin's inner self.

### Movement

Movement governs extraordinary means of locomotion, travel, and speed—as well as secondary effects that are tied to these spheres. Movement is typically used to invoke boons such as *haste*, *teleport*, and *flight*. However, the GM may call for a straight Movement roll when the success of the action isn't tied so much to the successful invocation of the boon as it is to the circumstances of the action. The examples below illustrate such instances.

#### Challenging Test of Movement (CR 15)

Victoria is trying to create enough of a distraction to allow her ally, Nick, to escape from the two junkyard thugs who have him at gun point. She taps into her telekinetic powers to create a storm of debris from the junk littered around the area, attempting to throw the thugs' attention away from Nick.

**Success with a twist:** The whirlwind of junk distracts the guards long enough to let Nick dive behind some cover and grab an improvised weapon, but the thugs are right on his tail.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Nick thinks he's got a chance to make a break for it, but Victoria's powers fail her at just the wrong moment, and one of the thugs pistol whips Nick unconscious as he attempts to escape.


#### Heroic Test of Movement (CR 20)

Gizmo's party is attempting to evade a pack of wererats amidst the narrow alleys and busy streets of Ystril. The GM asks each PC to describe what they are doing to escape their pursuers. Gizmo decides to rely on the power of his patented Mark VI Rocket Boots to propel him from rooftop to rooftop.

**Success with a twist:** Much to the surprise of his allies, Gizmo's invention does the trick, and he easily evades the
wererats pursuing him. However, he has pushed them to the limit, and they will not function again until he can get access to a workshop and repair them.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Gizmo's Rocket Boots hurl him haphazardly about the city, and to no one's surprise, they conk out mid-air in an explosion of gears and smoke, sending the gnome hurdling into dark alley. When he gets to his feet, he finds himself flanked by wererats.

#### Epic Test of Movement (CR 25)

Ace is piloting the escape pod his crew used to break free from InterGal HQ. Their escape did not go unnoticed, however, and the pod is being pulled back in by the star cruiser's tractor beam. In a last ditch effort to secure their freedom, Ace jacks himself into the pod's power matrix and attempts to use every trick up his sleeve to boost its velocity beyond the force of the tractor beam.

**Success with a twist:** Ace manages to override all of the pod's failsafes in order to redirect every ounce of its power into the forward thrust. The ship escapes the tractor beam, but its navigation systems get fried in the process. The crew no longer has control over their trajectory, and must drift aimlessly through space until they can manage a repair or find some aid.





**Failure, but the story progresses:** Ace can't break the ship's safety protocols, and the pod is quickly swallowed back into InterGal HQ. It will only be a matter of minutes until they are swarmed by Galactic Troops.

### Prescience

Prescience is the attribute that governs knowledge gained from extraordinary sources such as extrasensory perception, divination magic, or even a super heightened awareness of details. You make a Prescience roll whenever you are attempting to use means beyond the scope of a normal creature in order to perceive details or communicate with beings that would otherwise be impossible.

#### Challenging Test of Prescience (CR 15)

loading dock  into the parking lot. Victoria, gifted with psychic abilities ever since the Event, attempts to gain a glimpse of the risk of each path. The GM knows that a handful of zombies crawl about the ducts and that an entire horde lurks in the loading dock.

**Success with a twist:** Victoria gets impressions of death in the air ducts, but she is a neophyte in the ways of her powers, and suffers a severe headache before she can get a reading on the loading bay.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Victoria's mind is too cluttered by the moans and groans of the undead to effectively get a reading. Even worse, the zombies have started to tear down the gate, so the group must make a decision immediately on which path to take.

#### Heroic Test of Prescience (CR 20)

As Shane chases him through the corridors of Payne Manor, the Doctor ducks into a side room. Seconds later, Shane busts into the room, only to find no sign of the Doctor, and no other visible exits. Unbeknownst to our hero, his quarry has opened a secret passage behind a bookshelf that is activated

by dialing a number on the phone that rests on a nearby desk. Shane takes a deep breath, calms his nerves, and attempts to use his cybernetically enhanced senses to detect the Doctor.

**Success with a twist:** Shane gains no perception of the secret passage, but he does notice that the phone is slightly askew and the items nearby it disheveled as if having been  recently disturbed.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Shane loses the Doctor, and he wastes a good deal of time in the study trying to pick up a trail. By the time he gives up hope, the Doctor is long gone.


#### Epic Test of Prescience (CR 25)

Ruby is investigating the scene of the lord mayor's assassination. There are no obvious physical signs of the cause of death, so she touches her hand to the mayor's heart and attempts to communicate with his spirit and learn whatever she can.


**Success with a twist:** Ruby can speak briefly with the mayor. However, her connection with his troubled soul becomes semi-permanent. She is tortured by his desire for vengeance until his killer is brought to justice. While this effect persists, Ruby suffers one level of the *fatigued* bane.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** In her attempts to contact the dead, Ruby instead makes contact with something far more sinister. An undead shadow takes form before her and attacks.

### Protection

The Protection attribute represents a character's extraordinary means of preventing harm, warding off danger, and breaking unwanted control. You might make a Protection roll in order to keep allies safe in the face of a trap or hazard, prevent unwanted creatures from approaching, or hold back a powerful force of nature.

As Balthazar and his companions make their way up the narrow ledge that encircles the Mountain of Shade, a snowy gale of unnatural force threatens to hurl them to their doom. Balthazar slams his staff into the ground and utters a spell of shielding to wrap his companions in a shield of force to deflect the wind.

**Success with a twist:** Balthazar manages to complete his spell, but his shield is not as big as he had hoped, and two of his companions must still resist the winds on their own.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** The mighty gale hurls Balthazar's staff from his hands before he can finish the spell. Now he must not only fight to remain on the cliff, but he also risks losing his staff.

#### Heroic Test of Protection (CR 20)

Star and her platoon pilot their mechanized combat suits through the wastelands of Primus, the first moon of New Terra. During their week-long trek, one of Primus' much-feared corrosive acid clouds settles over the soldiers, threatening to slowly eat away at their armor. The GM asks each PC what they are doing to protect their mechas, and Star decides to use her Protection attribute to activate her suit's enviro shields to ward off the acid.

**Success with a twist:** Star's enviro shield does the trick, but the acid storm is so strong that she is forced to reroute power from her mech's combat defenses in order to maintain the shield. As long as she keeps her enviro shield up, Star's max HP is reduced by 5.

**Failure, but the story progresses:** Star's enviro shield just wasn't meant for such prolonged exposure to corrosive matter of this level. After three days in the acid cloud, her mech's hull is severely corroded, reducing her Armor bonus by 3 until it can be repaired.
