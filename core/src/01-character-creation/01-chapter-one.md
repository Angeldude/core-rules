# Chapter 1: Character Creation

Before you can start telling your story, you'll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you'll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you'll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.

*Who were the characters you identified with?*

*Who inspired you?*

Now that you've got some of your favorites in mind, let's create your character.

## Step 1: Describe Your Character

Open Legend is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can't think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that's a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your **size**: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10'x10' square in combat and has a 10' reach (see Chapter 7: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.

At the GM's discretion, you may choose to be smaller or larger than the listed sizes. A large creature's reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15'x15' base would have a 15' reach. All creatures have at least a 5' reach.

<div style="padding-top: 104px;"></div>

> ##### No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?
> In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you'll have a chance to further define your character in a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing a psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the *scent* perk to highlight your hunter's bloodline and the *observant* perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the *hot tempered* flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.

<div style="padding: 100px;"></div>

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits.** Maybe you stutter when you're nervous. Maybe you don't trust anyone until they've proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won't find out about until they've gotten to know you quite well. It's also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into the campaign.

<div style="padding: 60px;"></div>

> ##### Example Character Secrets
> Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.
>
> ---
>
> Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that's when he began his road to the priesthood.
>
> ---
>
> Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, both physically and mentally.

## Step 2: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in Open Legend. They define what your character can and can't do--the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you'll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In Open Legend, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and extraordinary.

A character's skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero, though physical, social, and mental attributes may still be used untrained.

The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish. All of the attributes are explained in further detail in Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes.

In Open Legend, you get to define your character's strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: -30px;">
##### Attribute Quick Builds
</div>

|  |
| :-: |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |

<div style="margin-top: -30px"></div>

### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don't have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div style="text-align: center">
##### Purchasing Attributes
</div>

| Attribute Score | Cost <div style="width: 380px;"></div> |
| :-: | :-----: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You'll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div style="text-align: center;">
##### Attribute Dice
</div>

| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |
| 6 | 2d8 |
| 7 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 3d10 |
| 10 | 4d8 |


## Step 3: Record Defenses, Hit Points, and Speed

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with the shot of a rifle, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class='descriptive'>
** <div style="text-align: center"> Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will </div> **
</div>


**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or stun you will target your toughness.


<div class='descriptive'>
** <div style="text-align: center"> Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor </div> **
</div>

**Guard** protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.

<div class='descriptive'>
** <div style="text-align: center"> Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will </div> **
</div>

**Resolve** represents your character's ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.


<div class='descriptive'>
** <div style="text-align: center"> Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 </div> **
</div>


*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

**Speed** indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 7: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.

<br>

> ##### Roll Them Bones
> If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.
>
>
> As you play Open Legend, you'll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. **Dice notation** is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.
>
> Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the *d* indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the *d* indicates how many sides those dice have.
>
> So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.
>
> 5d4 indicates five four-sided dice.

<br>

With your character created, you are all ready to start playing Open Legend. Whether you're playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you're completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.

### Relax

Open Legend gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels--but whatever you do, shake the dice like your character's life depends on it and have fun. If you're playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character's a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you're no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party's escapades, and so on.

### Respect the GM

If you've never GM'd before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don't cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there's a dispute over the rules, accept the GM's final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of keeping the game going.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Respect the Other Players

Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing Open Legend, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM's duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.

## Step 4: Purchase Feats

While your character's attributes define your skill at accomplishing heroic tasks, your **feats** are what make you unique among other characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting you the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so she takes the *Combat Momentum* feat to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes *Battle Trance* so that he can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list
[*here*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).


## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of Open Legend, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a wealth score of 2, and may select up to three items of wealth level 2 and any number of items of a lesser wealth level. See chapter 5 for rules concerning wealth as well as equipment details. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.

## Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws

Perks and flaws provide you with additional ways to define your character's personality, appearance, strengths, weaknesses, and background. Complete descriptions of the available perks and flaws, as well as how they are used in play, are described in Chapter 4: Perks & Flaws.

At character creation, you may optionally choose up to two perks and up to two flaws. You do not have to choose any.

## Step 7: Tell Your Story
foes whenever the opportunity presents itself.




## Archetype Builds

This section contains an assortment of characters built for a variety of
genres. If you do not want to create your own character from scratch,
you can use these as is. Just add your own perks, flaws, and descriptive
traits and you are ready to go. Alternatively, you might use one of
these archetypes to get you started, swapping out attributes and feats
to develop your own unique character concept for the setting that you
will be playing in.


### Bard

Bards are a little bit of everything: leaders, loremasters, artists,
performers, magicians, swashbucklers, and more. A bard is a
jack-of-all-trades who gets allies out of the frying pan just as often
as they land them in the fire.

#### Strategy

Bards can lend a helping hand in almost any non-combat scenario by using
their *well-rounded* feat, though they particularly excel in social
situations thanks to their strong Presence and Persuasion attributes.
Their Influence score also provides access to banes such as *charmed*
and *phantasm*, which can be useful for deceiving enemies, winning them
over, or prying information out of them.

In combat, a Bard supports allies with *bolster*, using the *boon focus*
feat to inspire as many allies as possible at once. When friends are
wounded, the Bard uses *heal* to get them back in the fight, and can
even help several allies hold the line by invoking a healing *aura*.
Bards are reasonably adept in melee combat, using their rapier to disarm. And so on.

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

### Battle Mage

Battle Mages are masters of might and magic. Gifted with innate talents
for melee combat and elemental sorcery, these elite soldiers are a force
to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The Battle Mage is typically
heavily armored, equipped with a variety of close combat weapons, and
crackling with raw magical energy.

#### Strategy

The Battle Mages were born and bred for combat, but they can still hold
their own in some non-combat situations. They are typically strong
leaders who carry an intimidating aura, capable of commanding attention
when the circumstances demand it.

In combat, Battle Mages serve as a one man front line brute squad. Their
heavy armor makes them nearly impervious to lesser foes, and their
command <br>
over  the elements of earth and ice allow them to <br>
control the battlefield with area attacks. Making use <br>
of the *multi-target attack
specialist* feat, they can attack multiple foes without hindrance. When
enemies do <br>
manage to outmaneuver their earthquakes and icy <br>
bolts, Battle
Mages are ready to engage in hand to <br>
hand combat with an arsenal of
weaponry for any <br>
occasion.

<div style='padding-top:2270px'></div>


### Beast Master

The Beast Master summons and commands the creatures of the wild, and is
capable of taming even monsters of great legend, such as dragons and
manticores. At home in the wilderness, Beast Masters even possess magic
to control plants, earth, and other natural elements.


#### Strategy

The Beast Master commands a legendary manticore, which serves as both
mount and combatant. The manticore’s flight
allows the Beast Master
access to areas that might be out of reach for the rest of the party.
Out of combat, Beast Masters can wield Alteration magic to shape the
terrain, transmute materials, or even summon creatures to aid in manual
labor and mundane tasks.

Once combat ensues, the Beast Master takes to the sky, picking off foes
with a longbow and commanding summoned creatures to gain control over
the battlefield. When their arrows aren’t getting the job done, the Beast Master doesn’t
hesitate to close into melee and let the manticore tear foes to shreds with its
razor sharp claws or disable them with its venomous sting.

### Berserker

Berserkers are the elite frontline forces of the barbarian hordes, known
for surmounting impossible odds. Those who don’t fall beneath the terror
of their frenzied rage will tell tales of the Berserkers’ mighty thews
that will be the stuff of nightmares for generations to come.

#### Strategy

Berserkers are born and bred for the sole purpose of slaying foes.
Outside of combat, they can occasionally lend a hand by bending bars,
lifting gates, or intimidating foes.

Once combat ensues, the Berserker is a near unstoppable killing machine.
Their two handed axe combined with a Might score of 5 ensures that the
Berserker will dish out considerable damage. They have exceptionally
high
&nbsp;
defenses, so Berserkers are always willing to call out
<br> foes with
the *provoked* bane. In particularly difficult <br>
fights, they will
activate their *battle trance* to fly <br>
into a rage, making their attacks
even more <br>
deadly and further improving their
survivability. <br>
Berserkers must use their rage
sparingly, <br>
however, as entering a *battle trance*
comes at <br>
the cost of one level of the <br>
*fatigued* bane.

___

<div style='padding-top:1955px'></div>

<div style="padding-left: 500px;">
### Chronomage
</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Chronomages see and manipulate the flow of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the most powerful force in
the universe: time. They
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
possess the power to unravel the very fabric of the
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
universe and rearrange it to suit their needs. Past, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present, and
future are all one to the Chronomage, and their preternatural connection
to the fourth dimension often creates rifts between those with a more
conventional understanding of time.


#### Strategy

Chronomages can both control the flow of time and see beyond its usual
boundaries. Out of combat, they use this sixth sense by way of the
*precognition* boon to peer into past and future events that are beyond
mortal ken.

When combat ensues, the Chronomage's control of time offers the party
options. Whether the Chronomage is slowing down time to allow their
companions to move with seemingly inhuman speed, speeding up the flow of
time to exhaust the enemy, or reversing time to close wounds, the
Chronomage is able to use their mastery over the fourth dimension to
gain an advantage in any situation. They make use of the *boon focus*
feat to invoke these beneficial baleful effects in a field around them
or an ally. *Attribute substitution* protects their fragile physical
forms, which are neither strong nor agile outside of their powers. When
enemies incur their wrath, the Chronomage hyperlapses time within foe’s
body, hastening the dissolving of bones and flesh.

### Courtier

Courtiers are career politicians who make it their life’s pursuit to be
an embodiment of majestic social grace. The air of gravitas that they
carry compels all who encounter them like clay in the courtier’s hands.
As a host, a courtier will often have a social gathering engineered down
to the most minute detail, such that guests feel exactly as the courtier
has planned for them to feel. Often they command respect with regal
attire, whether a showcase of Victorian splendor, Far Eastern grace, or
the sleek fashion of the world’s modern day rich and powerful.

#### Strategy

Specialized primarily in social situations and of little help when a
fight breaks out, a courtier invests most of their effort in engineering
circumstances to avoid bloodshed. When that fails, they aim to ally
themselves with the side heavily favored to win. This is accomplished
through the use of Deception, Persuasion, Presence, and Influence. Once
the Courtier has earned the trust of a powerful acquaintance via the
*charmed* bane, it’s common for the target to remain indefinitely loyal
to the Courtier, thanks to the *potent bane* and *unending charm* feats.

### Druid

Druids are defenders of nature who draw upon its power via a close bond
that enables them to shapechange into many of the powerful creatures
found in their natural habitats. Not all druids are attuned to the
woodlands. Some of them shapeshift into aquatic species and spend long
periods beneath the ocean’s surface, while others dwell as all manner of
avian species in mountain ranges that pierce the clouds high above.
Whatever their preferred habitat, druids are nothing if not adaptable.

#### Strategy

Being one with nature, druids tend to use natural surroundings to their
advantage, whether summoning up an imposing wall of briars with the
*barrier* boon, an animated vine that entwines the target with
*immobile*, or hastening the healing power of nature via the
*regeneration* boon. Druids also make excellent combatants and scouts.
As a scout, they are able to sneak unnoticed into an enemy camp as a
naturally occurring animal species. As a combatant, they can shift into
a massive and powerful creature, such as a bear to quickly
deal with enemies.

### Engineer
</div>

Engineers are infused with the <br>
spark of creation, and can <br>
comprehend the inner <br>
workings of extremely <br>
complex systems. While Engineers <br>
are typically dextrous and tough <br>
as nails, their real power lies in <br>
the cogwheel gadgets they whip up with ease <br>
from spare parts and salvaged goods. These <br>
hissing steam gizmos and mechanical <br>
implements ensure that the Engineer is <br>
prepared for any situation.

#### Strategy

In non-combat situations, the Engineer’s prowess <br>
comes from the versatility of their creations. <br>
Given enough time, they can use the *craft <br>extraordinary item* feat to prepare for a wide <br>
variety of situations. Whether they are <br>
building a 100’ ladder that can collapse <br>
to the size of a backpack, a remote <br>
controlled scout bot, or a wearable <br>
automated wound closing device, the <br>
Engineer can always find a way to <br>
put their creative skills to provide <br>
the party with utility and flexibility.

In combat, Engineers adjust their <br>
strategy to the problem at hand to <br>
support their companions. The <br>
*bolster* boon can represent <br>
anything from a pair of spring <br>
loaded boots to a guided <br>
targeting helmet. When <br>
enemies are overwhelming, the <br>
Engineer uses *summon creature* to <br>
activate one or
more of their combat bots. And if <br>
their fancy creations and jury-rigged gizmos <br>
aren’t doing the job, the Engineer is no <br>
slouch with a trusty old hand cannon.

### Gunslinger

Some are lawmen who serve as judge, jury, and executioner. Others are
bounty hunters trying to earn enough cash to pay off an old debt. Still
others are mercenaries who shoot for the highest bidder. Whatever their
motivation, all Gunslingers invoke fear from any fool unfortunate enough
to end up on the wrong end of their barrel.

#### Strategy

Gunslingers do more than just hurl lead. Their prowess in ranged combat
is fueled by entropic energy gained from otherworldly powers, either
purchased through diabolical pacts or earned through prowess of mind and
spirit. Out of combat, Gunslingers are perceptive and intimidating, and
they can overawe lesser folk with ease. While many Gunslingers are
loners bent solely on achieving their mission, those who step up to the
occasion make excellent leaders to pull a ragtag posse together into a
cohesive unit.

When a fight breaks out, Gunslingers keep their distance
and use their dual revolvers to rain hell down <br>
upon their foes. When damage alone isn’t
getting the job done, Gunslingers can aim their shots to hinder enemies
in all manner of ways: shooting their weapons out of their hands,
knocking the wind out of them, or blowing off a toe. The *multi-attack specialist*
feat allows them to shoot twice <br>
as fast as a lesser gunfighter, enabling them to
take on large groups of foes single-handedly. Supplementing <br>
their markshmanship
with dark powers, they invoke <br>
banes and boons with Entropy. Favorites include <br>
invoking *life drain* to
heal a little bit with every shot <br>
and afflicting enemies
with the *sickened* bane to <br>
render their attacks nearly
useless. When foes <br>
close in, a Gunslinger doesn’t hesitate to <br>
use Entropy to create a defensive *aura* or <br>
scare enemies away with *fear*.

Presence 3 (1d8), Entropy 4 (1d10)

### Hacker

Knowledge is power, as the saying goes, and the Hacker is a testament to
the fact that nearly anyone can be taken down with the right
information. Some Hackers are mercenaries that work for the highest
bidder, primarily in the game for the adrenaline rush and the thrill of
controlling massive amounts of data and the fates of those who depend on
it. Others rally
___
behind a larger cause with intent of changing the world
for better or worse.

#### Strategy

The Hacker is a master of data and information. Above all, they seek to
gather information and harness its power. Hackers use information to
piece together secrets and data which others assume is secured beyond
access. Out of combat, the Hacker uses banes and boons such as *seeing*
via their drone and *spying* or *precognition* to track information or
persons of interest through databases, servers, surveillance cameras,
credit card records, and and other sources of poorly encrypted data. If
deception is called for, Hackers can tap into Big Brother’s ever-present
communication systems to project holograms or audio transmissions using
the *phantasm* bane.

When combat breaks out, Hackers tend to avoid the front lines, relying
on their drones to do the fighting for them. From a secure vantage
point, the Hacker pilots the multi-purpose drone using a tablet or
similar device, using its mounted laser cannon to hold enemies back. In
addition to drone combat, Hackers also assist allies with the *bolster*
boon through illicit data and hacking nearby systems to gain an edge.

### Mystic

Mystics are typically found far removed from the hustle and bustle
of the city and detached from the advances of the society they left behind.
They prefer to listen to the still quiet voice
within, eschewing all material possessions and living as ascetics
attempting to purge themselves of all self-centered ambition.

#### Strategy

Out of combat, Mystics command a vast array of capabilities that make
them excellent information gatherers, detectives, and supernaturally
empowered forensic analysts. They are able to predict future danger via
the *precognition* boon, discover all manner of information by divining
an item’s past with the *reading* boon, utilize the *spying* bane to
track enemy movements from far away, and communicate with any creature
via the *telepathy* boon.

Mystics who have allied with a larger group typically utilize their
powers purely for defense and protection of others, invoking *bolster*
to impart psychic insight to allies, *mind dredge* to steal enemy
secrets, and using Protection to perform defend actions with the help of
the *defensive reflexes* feat. Mystics are also adept at shutting down
enemy boons via *nullify*, as well as canceling banes afflicting allies
via the *hospitaler* feat.

___
- **Attributes:** Learning 3 (1d8), Will 3 (1d8), Creation 2 (1d6), Prescience 5 (2d6), Protection 4 (1d10)
- **Hit Points:** 16
- **Guard:** 10

- *Pierce the Veil* (invoke *precognition*): Prescience vs. 12 - 20 (PL 1 - 5)
- *Rejuvenate* (invoke *heal*): Creation vs. 12 - 14 (PL 1 - 2)

```
```

### Ningyozukai

The Ningyozukai, or Puppeteers, are sorcerers capable of channeling
their spirit to possess enchanted suits of Yoroi armor, transforming the
armor into a powerful animated weapon. Also gifted with magics of
healing and protection, the Ningyozukai only call on their Yoroi armor
when circumstances call for force of arms or brute strength.

#### Strategy

The Ningyozukai make use of the *alternate form* feat in order to
provide two distinct character options that may be swapped as needed. In
their normal form, they are physically frail sorcerers who offer support
to the party through boons such as *resistance, heal,* and *bolster*. In
combat, their only means of inflicting damage is by using *summon
creature* to call forth minor guardian spirits.

<img style="max-width: 2420px; position: absolute; bottom: 105px; right: -40px;"
  src="http://localhost:8888/_not_full_page/ningyozukai_forrest_imel.png" />


\page

<div class='pageNumber auto'></div>

When the situation calls for it, the sorcerer will animate their Yoroi
armor, which serves as an indestructible melee warrior. The Yoroi form
has very high defenses and hit points, and its Might score of 5 combined
with a two-handed naginata ensures that it will deal out significant
damage while also manipulating the battlefield with banes such as
*knockdown, forced move,* and *immobile*. In particularly difficult
fights, the Yoroi enters a *battle trance*, gaining even stronger
defenses and better attack prowess.

Although the Ningyozukai make use of the *alternate form* feat, they do
not actually physically transform when switching between sorcerer or
Yoroi forms. Rather, the Yoroi armor, possessed by the sorcerer’s
spirit, surrounds their frail master to encase and protect them.
Activating the *alternate form* feat represents the sorcerer focusing
all of their will on possessing the Yoroi to make full use of its
offensive powers. Thus, the Ningyozukai only has the capability of using
actions and taking turns with one of its forms at any time.

#### Sorcerer Form

___
- **Attributes:** Agility 1 (1d4), Learning 3 (1d8), <br>Perception 1 (1d4), Will 3 (1d8), Persuasion 3 (1d8), Creation 4 (1d10), Protection 4 (1d10)

(PL 1 - 3)

### Ranger

Rangers are folk of the wilderness, hunters, and animal tamers. They can
navigate the harshest of terrains and their keen eyes can pick up a
trail that has been cold for days. With a faithful animal companion by
their side, the Ranger is never alone on the hunt.

#### Strategy

Rangers are expert trackers, making use of their *fast tracker* and
*master tracker* feats to follow quarry effortlessly without slowing
down. Their exceptional Perception score also means that the Ranger will
be the eyes of the party: locating traps, scouting for enemies, and
revealing hidden passages. Their extraordinary ability to climb allows
them to access paths that might be unreachable by their allies.

When combat breaks out, the Ranger typically fights in a coordinated
effort with their animal companion. In melee, the wolf will attempt to
inflict *knockdown* upon foes, allowing their master to strike with
advantage 1 on prone enemies. When they aren’t striking for direct
damage, Rangers are disarming foes or whittling away at them with
*persistent damage*. If the Ranger needs to keep a distance from the
enemy, they take to the trees and use their longbow while their wolf
companion uses *immobile* to make the target an easy shot for their
master.

### Shade

Shades are highly trained assassins that draw upon unearthly power
from the in-between the void of shadows where most mortals dare not
travel. One with the darkness, they use their powers to deceive and
misdirect, catching their prey off guard. These night hunters are
trained to slay from a distance--unseen, unheard, and without a trace.

#### Strategy

While Shades are trained for the specific task of neutralizing threats,
their ability to manipulate shadows provides them with exceptional
utility. Out of combat, they make excellent scouts, capable of hiding
weapons in the extradimensional void with *absorb object*. Their ability
to pass through the void makes them peerless at infiltration. When
*teleporting*, even a titanium vault or door is no obstacle for a Shade
as they step through the void or dematerialize into a cloud of inky
entropy and slip beneath a door.

Shades prefer to remain hidden as much as possible so that when combat
ensues they can catch their foes off guard. They fire their silenced
sniper rifles from cover, and quickly *teleport* to a new location
before they are discovered. On rare occasions where they are spotted,
they use *haste* to make a fast getaway or blanket an area in *darkness*
and slip away unseen.

### Spellsword

Equally skilled with a blade as they are with sorcery, Spellswords weave
magic and martial prowess together into a powerful combination. Whether
they are setting foes ablaze with a flaming sword, summoning barriers of force to deflect

___
attacks, or outmaneuvering foes with teleportation,
Spellswords control the battlefield with unrivaled magic.

#### Strategy

The Spellsword is a master of versatility. Although they shine the most
in the heat of battle, Spellswords can also make use of Protection and
Movement attributes to provide utility to overcome many obstacles.

Within combat, the Spellsword’s *attribute substitution* feat allows
them to use their Energy score for weapon attacks, and their trio of
extraordinary attributes provides them with access to a versatile
selection of banes and boons. *Lightning reflexes* ensures that they
will often act early in combat, and Spellswords will use this
opportunity to invoke the *resistance* boon or inflict a vulnerable
target with *persistent <br>
damage*. Once combat is underway, Spellswords <br>
focus on finishing off damaged foes so that they <br>
can use *combat momentum* to maneuver <br>
around the battlefield.

### Void Templar

An ancient order of warrior-mages, the Void Templars undergo over a
decade of training before they are even permitted their first attempt at
the rigorous test <br>
which initiates them as full Templars. A deadly <br>
mix of soldier and void wielder, they form a <br>
heavily armored support unit
trained to keep <br>
other soldiers out of harm’s way. Their highly<br>
coveted guardian armor amplifies their <br>
control of the void,
supercharging their <br>
power to nullify enemy attacks.

#### Strategy

Void Templars are built to defend, <br>
wielding power from the void that <br>
swallows up attacks from lasers, <br>
magic, and all manner of attacks. Using <br>
their exceptionally high Energy attribute, <br>
the Templars can call upon
the void to nullify <br>
almost any attack. Although their heavy <br>
armor makes them slower than the <br>
standard soldier, they can *teleport* or <br>
even invoke *aura: haste* to speed up <br>
themselves and their comrades. Also, <br>
*teleport* allows them to access areas <br>
and bypass obstacles that others <br>
might struggle with.

Within combat, a Templar’s primary duty is to <br>
keep their allies alive. They make extensive use <br>
of the defend action by deploying all manner of <br>
countermeasures from their Templar Armor, <br>
such as laser netting, or the
onboard nano <br>
missiles to intercept incoming projectiles. <br>
Their *battlefield reflexes* feat allows the Templar <br>
to turn these defensive actions against the attacker. <br>
In addition to these countermeasures,
Templars also <br>
reshape the battlefield and force enemies into tough

___
decisions with banes and boons such as *forced move, barrier,* and
*immobile.*

## Gaining XP and Leveling Up

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character's power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.

Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters and enemy or ally NPCs. The Player Character Level Advancement table details the XP requirements and maximum attribute score for each level.

<div style="text-align: center">
##### Player Character Level Advancement
</div>

| Total XP <div style="width: 400px;"></div> | Level | Maximum <br> Attribute Score |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 6 |
| 9 | 4 | 6 |
| 12 | 5 | 7 |
| 15 | 6 | 7 |
| 18 | 7 | 8 |
| 21 | 8 | 8 |
| 24 | 9 | 9 |
| 27 | 10 | 9 |

### Feat and Attribute Points

For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points *every* time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.

Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.

See [*Chapter 3: Feats*](#pXX) to view the complete list of feats to choose from.


<div style="text-align: center">
##### Attribute Overview
</div>

| Attribute Score | Cost | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 3 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 6 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 10 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 15 | 2d6 |
| 6 | 21 | 2d8 |
| 7 | 28 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 36 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 45 | 3d10 |
| 10 | - | 4d8 |

**Note:** An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.

### New Hit Points

In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you'll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.

## Starting Beyond First Level

Sometimes a new player will join a campaign in progress in which the other PCs have already advanced several levels, so it would be unbalanced to insert a first level character into the party. Other times, the GM may decide to run a campaign with PCs who have already accumulated some wealth and power. In situations like these, you can use the Characters Beyond First Level table to determine attribute points, feat points, and wealth for PCs. When choosing starting gear, you may select three items of your current wealth score and any number of lesser valued items.
