# Chapter 1: Character Creation #

Before you can start telling your story, you'll need a character to play. This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you'll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you'll learn what to do when you level up.

Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.

*Who were the characters you identified with?*

*Who inspired you?*

Now that you've got some of your favorites in mind, let's create your character.

If you find a character you would like to use, simply copy the spreadsheet and adjust as you see fit. The spreadsheets include formulas to do most of the calculations for you, and you can adjust the **Level** field to generate the appropriate number of feat and attribute points if you are creating a character above first level.

## Step 1: Describe Your Character

Open Legend is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can't think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.

**A heroic name.** Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.

**Your race.** Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that's a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.

As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your **size**: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10'x10' square in combat and has a 10' reach (see Chapter 7: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.

At the GM's discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the sizes described above. A large creature's reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15'x15' base would have a 15' reach. Small creatures always have at least a 5' reach.

> ### No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?
> In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you'll have a chance to further define your character in a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing a psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the *scent* perk to highlight your hunter's bloodline and the *observant* perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the *hot tempered* flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.

**Two exceptional physical traits.** Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?

**Two defining social traits.** Maybe you stutter when you're nervous. Maybe you don't trust anyone until they've proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.

**A secret.** Your secret is something that other characters probably won't find out about until they've gotten to know you quite well. It's also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into the campaign.

> ### Example Character Secrets
> Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.
>
> * * * * *
>
> Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child--that's when he began his road to the priesthood.
>
> * * * * *
>
> Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, both physically and mentally.


## Step 2: Choose Attributes

Attributes are the backbone of every character in Open Legend. They define what your character can and can't do--the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you'll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.

In Open Legend, attributes are divided into four categories: physical,
social, mental, and extraordinary.

A character's skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero, though physical, social, and mental attributes may still be used untrained.

The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.

The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish. All of the attributes are explained in further detail in Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes.

In Open Legend, you get to define your character's strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept. Described below are several methods by which you can assign your attributes.

### Quick Build

If you are new to roleplaying games, or are just looking to get your character built quickly, choose one of the attribute sets listed in the Attribute Quick Builds table. Assign the scores listed to the attributes that define the type of character you want to play. The rest of your attributes begin with a score of zero.

<div class="table-centered"></div>
| ATTRIBUTE QUICK BUILDS |
| - |
| **Specialized Hero** |
| 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2 |
| **Well-rounded Hero** |
| 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1 |
| **Jack of All Trades** |
| 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1 |


### Custom Build

If you would like more control over your attributes, you can purchase them to create your own set. With this method, at first level, you have a budget of 40 attribute points to spend, and the cost of each score is defined in the Purchasing Attributes table. The highest any score can reach at first level is 5, and you don't have to spend all of your points at character creation.

<div class="table-no-body table-centered"></div>
| PURCHASING ATTRIBUTES |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Cost |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 6 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 15 |

### Archetype Build
In the Archetype Attribute Builds table, several common fantasy archetypes are listed. If you are envisioning a character similar to one of these, you can just take one of these sets as written, or swap out some of the attributes for others.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| ARCHETYPE ATTRIBUTE BUILDS |

| Will 1 | Learning 1 | Logic 1  |
| Entropy 3 | Creation 2 | Will 2  |
| Movement 3 | Influence 4 | Movement 3  |
| | | Protection 5 |


### Record Attribute Dice

Every attribute score above 0 grants you bonus dice to increase your chance of success. Consult the Attribute Dice table for each of your attributes and record the appropriate dice. (You'll learn what to do with these dice later on.)

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Dice |
| - |
| |
<div></div>
| Attribute Score | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 2d6 |
| 6 | 2d8 |
| 7 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 3d10 |
| 10 | 4d8 |

<br><br>

> ### Roll Them Bones
> If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.
>
> As you play Open Legend, you'll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. **Dice notation** is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.
>
> Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the *d* indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the *d* indicates how many sides those dice have.
>
> So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.
>
> 5d4 indicates five four-sided dice.
>
> And so on.

<br><br>

## Step 3: Record Defenses, Hit Points, and Speed

When an enemy tries to attack you--whether with the shot of a rifle, a deft sword thrust, or a mental assault--it will first need to overcome your defense. You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will |
| - |
| |

**Toughness** protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or stun you will target your toughness.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor |
| - |
| |

**Guard** protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will  |
| - |
| |

**Resolve** represents your character's ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger. Enemies who wish to charm you, deceive you with illusions, or frighten you must target your resolve.

<div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Hit Points = 2 x (Fortitude + Presence + Will) + 10 |
| - |
| |

*That is, add your Fortitude, Presence, and Will scores. Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.*

**Hit Points** (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.

**Speed** indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 7: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.

## Step 4: Purchase Feats

While your character's attributes define your skill at accomplishing heroic tasks, your **feats** are what make you unique among other characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting you the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.

For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so she takes the *Combat Momentum* feat to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes *Battle Trance* so that he can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate foes.

### Choose your feats

Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.

You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list
[*here*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats).

If your character is based on a specific archetype, you may want to
start with the feat selections recommended below:

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Feat Recommendations |
| - |
| |

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Battle Trance | Master Tracker | Multi-target Attack Specialist 1 (melee) |
| Reckless Frenzy | Fleet of Foot 1 | Martial Focus (Unarmed) |
| | Attack Specialization 1 (Longbow) | Combat Momentum |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Paladin | Battle Mage | Mind Mage |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Attribute Substitution 2 (Presence > Might)  | Attack Specialization 1 (Cold) | Hallucination |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| Martial Focus (Dagger) | Boon Focus 1 (Heal) | Boon Focus 2 (Shapeshift) |
| Lethal Strike 1 | Armor Mastery 1 |  |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Shadowdancer | Bard | Arcane Protector |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Lethal Strike 1 | Boon Focus 1 (Bolster) | Defensive Reflexes 1 |
| Boon Focus 1 (Teleport) | Boon Focus 1 (Heal) | Boon Focus 1 (Teleport) |

<br><br>

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

In a typical game of Open Legend, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.

Usually, though, you begin with a wealth score of 2, and may select up to three items of wealth level 2 and any number of items of a lesser wealth level. See chapter 5 for rules concerning wealth as well as equipment details. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.

Instead of purchasing equipment a la carte, you may also elect to choose one of the following starting packages built for common character archetypes.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Archetype Starting Packages |
| - |
| |

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Barbarian | Ranger | Monk |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Maul | Longbow | Quarterstaff |
| Hatchet | Dagger | Hatchet |
| Tower Shield | Longsword | Leather Armor |
| Long Bow | Chain Shirt | |
| Battle Axe | | |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| Great Sword | Dagger | Dagger |
| Tower Shield | Leather Armor | Leather Armor |
| Scale Mail | | |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>
| Assassin | Cleric | Druid |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 5 Daggers | Flail | Quarterstaff |
| Shortbow | Scale Shirt | Longbow |
| Hand Crossbow | Tower Shield | Dagger |
| Leather Armor | Short Bow | Scale Shirt |

<br>

<div class="table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div>

| :- | :- | :- |
| 5 Daggers | Dagger | Short Bow |
| Shortbow | Longbow | Quarterstaff |
| Hand Crossbow | Longsword | Dagger |
| Leather Armor | Leather Armor | Leather Armor |

## Step 6: Choose Perks and Flaws

Perks and flaws provide you with additional ways to define your character's personality, appearance, strengths, weaknesses, and background. Complete descriptions of the available perks and flaws, as well as how they are used in play, are described in Chapter 4: Perks & Flaws.

At character creation, you may optionally choose up to two perks and up to two flaws. You do not have to choose any.

## Step 7: Tell Your Story

With your character created, you are all ready to start playing Open Legend. Whether you're playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you're completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.

### Relax

Open Legend gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels--but whatever you do, shake the dice like your character's life depends on it and have fun. If you're playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character's a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you're no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party's escapades, and so on.

### Respect the GM

If you've never GM'd before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don't cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there's a dispute over the rules, accept the GM's final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of keeping the game going.

### Respect the Other Players

Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing Open Legend, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM's duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.

## Gaining XP and Leveling Up

As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character's power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.

Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters and enemy or ally NPCs. The Player Character Level Advancement table details the XP requirements and maximum attribute score for each level.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Player Character Level Advancement |
| - |
| |

<br>

| Total XP | Level | Maximum Attribute Score |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 6 |
| 9 | 4 | 6 |
| 12 | 5 | 7 |
| 15 | 6 | 7 |
| 18 | 7 | 8 |
| 21 | 8 | 8 |
| 24 | 9 | 9 |
| 27 | 10 | 9 |

### Feat and Attribute Points

For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points *every* time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.

Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.

See [*Feats*](http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats) to view the complete list of feats to choose from.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
| Attribute Overview |
| - |
| |

<br>

| Attribute Score | Cost | Attribute Dice |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 1 | 1d4 |
| 2 | 3 | 1d6 |
| 3 | 6 | 1d8 |
| 4 | 10 | 1d10 |
| 5 | 15 | 2d6 |
| 6 | 21 | 2d8 |
| 7 | 28 | 2d10 |
| 8 | 36 | 3d8 |
| 9 | 45 | 3d10 |
| 10 | - | 4d8 |

**Note:** An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.

### New Hit Points

In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you'll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.

## Starting Beyond First Level

Sometimes a new player will join a campaign in progress in which the other PCs have already advanced several levels, so it would be unbalanced to insert a first level character into the party. Other times, the GM may decide to run a campaign with PCs who have already accumulated some wealth and power. In situations like these, you can use the Characters Beyond First Level table to determine attribute points, feat points, and wealth for PCs. When choosing starting gear, you may select three items of your current wealth score and any number of lesser valued items.

<div class="table-no-body"></div>
