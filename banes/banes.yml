    Wielding protective magic, you force an extraplanar creature to return to its home plane.
  effect: |
    The creature is forced to return to its home plane.  More powerful extraplanar beings may have ways of circumventing this banishment. However, typical non-legendary beings cannot. While the duration is instantaneous, the targeted creature cannot simply attempt to return by plane shifting immediately after being banished. The creature can attempt a Resist roll once per week to end the banishment and once again be capable of plane shifting to the plane they were previously banished from.

    Charms are one of the great banes of legend, wielded by powerful enchantresses like Circe (in Homer's The Odyssey), nymphs, and other enchanters who control the will of others, not through total domination, but through a magical spell of love or friendship.
  effect: |
    The charmed bane can only be inflicted via a bane attack. Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The Charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.
    <strong>Minor Charm</strong> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately.  If they are about to strike you with a piece of furniture, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent.  If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.
    <strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The attacker is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.
    The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm, creatures of humanoid intelligence. You can Major Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can Major Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence</li>
      </ul>
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the targets true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control.  As such, at the end of each of it’s turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Utilizing either incredible precision or the power of entropy, the target’s life force is snuffed out completely. The most deadly assassins and most powerful necromancers are known for such legendary skill at snuffing out life.
  effect: |
    You attempt to completely snuff the life force of your target.  There is a brief window of time in which the target can attempt to resist this extinguishing force, but once that window closes, the death is permanent and can only be reversed with resurrection magic.  When the bane is initially applied, the target is immobile (can’t move from their current square) and unconscious. They have disadvantage 5 on all perception rolls, and are incapable of moving. As a result of being completely incapable of movement, an incapacitated character can be the victim of a finishing blow.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from being aware of their affliction and thus prevents them from actively attempting to break free. However, the targets body fights to regain consciousness and resist the pending death.  As such, at the end of each of it’s turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  Whereas 3 failed resist rolls would usually persist the effects of the bane, this bane extinguishes the life force of the target on 3 failed saves, thus it is permanent. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    Though rare, domination is seen from time to time in legendary tales, often wielded by vampires, and sometimes wielded by the most powerful mentalist sorcerers who command legions of mindless zombies, completely enslaved to their will.
  effect: |
    <strong>Lesser Domination</strong> - the target obeys a one word command until the end of their next turn
    <strong>Greater Domination</strong> - The target's every action and move is under your control. Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions but their minds are free to think anything, though they are effectively trapped in their own body. They cannot take action of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  The attacker does not gain special access to the target’s mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think or know (from prior knowledge) that the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a normal action, however the order can be a series of verbal commands like “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee.”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command. Only one such command can be active at a given time, so giving a new command cancels all previous ones.
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, certain undead, etc.) with the Lesser Domination.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - You can target creatures of human intelligence or better with Greater Domination. You can target creatures of subhuman intelligence (animals, some elementals, etc.) with Greater Domination.</li>

    Fatigue overcomes the target, causing their body to gradually cease normal function until they rest.
  effect: |
    This bane has multiple tiers which are applied in succession; each time this bane is inflicted, if it is already in effect on the target, the severity escalates by one step.<br/>
    <strong>Special:</strong> unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion, removes one level of fatigue. If the Restoration boon is invoked, the character invoking it can remove one level of Fatigue (in addition to that removed by natural rest) if their attribute used to invoke Restoration is between 1 and 6. A target cannot benefit from another invocation of the Restoration boon until 24 hours have passed. If the Restoration boon's invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one.
     <ul>
     <li>Level 1 - The target has Disadvantage 1 on all non-attack action rolls. This </li>
     <li>Level 2 - The target loses their attribute bonus to their defense score (Agility for Evasion, Fortitude for Toughness, Will and Presence for Resolve). They retain any armor, supernatural, or feat bonuses.</li>
     <li>Level 3 - The target has Disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.</li>
     <li>Level 4 - The target is affected by the Slowed bane, reducing it's speed to 2 (though removing the condition can occur only via normal means to remove the Fatigued bane)</li>
     <li>Level 5 - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances are preventing them from resting peacefully.</li>
     <li>Level 6 - The target dies.</li>

  effect: |
    You restrict another character's movement, preventing them from moving from their current square. If you invoked the bane with a Might roll, then both you (the attacker) and the target are Immobile in your current squares for the duration of the bane. In subsequent rounds, you can roll the attack again - if successful, you can move your movement and take the target with you.  If this attack fails, you can only move by first releasing the target and ending the bane.
    If you invoked the bane with any attribute other than Might, you can move freely while the target remains affected
    You can choose to release the target at any time (a free action that immediately ends the bane).

    Illusory phantasms come in many shapes and forms, but they boil down to one thing – a manifestation of something that is not real, which is seen by anyone within range of sight / hearing / smell etc. Not to be confused with hallucination (see the description in the POWERS section), which is one creature completely dominating the sensory perception of another.
  effect: |
    Any time that a character interacts with a phantasm, they make a challenge roll as a free action (DL = Attribute score of the phantasm’s creator). This challenge roll is in addition to the resist roll that all characters receive beginning the turn after the attacker stops concentrating or fails to sustain the phantasm. Beyond that, phantasms have a cumulative power level determined with how many senses they deceive as detailed below.

    Persistent damage comes in many different types, including, but not limited to: cold, fire, acid, electricity, entropic, poison, wounding, etc. Persistent damage can apply from environmental conditions (the 9th plane of Hell should have a persistent fire damage effect in most campaign worlds), or from an action roll that includes the bane. Some types of fireball attacks might produce an powerful explosion that does more damage initially, where another type of fireball might have a “continual burn” effect, causing all within the initial blast to take persistent fire damage.
  effect: |
    Persistent damage is automatically applied at the beginning of the afflicted character(s) turn(s) before they roll a resist roll against it. As noted in “power level” above, there are 3 tiers of persistent damage. This damage automatically bypasses the afflicted character’s defenses but it can be reduced by any resistance to damage of a certain type (see the RESISTANCE boon). Persistent damage comes in a number of different variations: Physical damage (bleeding damage from a vital strike), Energy damage (lightning, fire, cold, acid, etc.) and entropic damage (necromantic energy).  Each variation has a it’s own cure; when that cure is applied with a normal action (either by the afflicted character, or another), the target receives a Resist roll with advantage (as a free action) to end the effect.  Some cures for the respective energy types include: Bleeding => Knowledge (Medical) / Creation / Profession: Healer, Lightning => discharge or grounding of the current / curcuit, Cold => warmth, heat, or fire, Acid => alkalizing agents (powder, milk, etc.) … The GM has the final word on whether a proposed cure can help a given type of persistent damage.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power Level 2</strong> - 1d4 damage per round.</li>

  description: |
    Peering into a supernatural conduit sucy as a hearth, a bubbling cauldron, or a crystal ball, you see can view the target if they are on the same plane
  effect: |
    If your roll is successful, you can view a sentient target that you are familiar with from any distance, provided they are in the same dimension or plane of reality.
    You may also scry on places that you are familiar with. If a non-ally with a higher Resolve defense is present in that place, then that individual's Resolve defense is used instead. Otherwise, the place being targeted gains a defense score as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>20</strong> - 1 mile or less</li>
    <li><strong>22</strong> - 100 miles or less</li>
    <li><strong>24</strong> - Same dimension or plane of reality</li>
    <li><strong>28</strong> - Any dimension or plane of reality. Peering into certain dimensions may expose you to other dangers at the GM's discretion.</li>
    </ul>
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of it's duration, you can make a normal attack roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.
    You can attempt to scry the same target any number of times, but if your attack roll to target them fails, that target becomes immune to your scrying for 24 hours.

    Silence overcomes the target (whether from magically warping sound around the target) or a physical effect like strangulation / suffocation.
  effect: |
    If AGILITY or ENTROPY was used in the attack, then the character is suffering strangulation and unable to speak.  In addition to that, if ALTERATION was used in the attack, all sound within 5’ of the target is magically suppressed, making their footsteps and the usual “clank” of belongings they are carrying inaudible.

    Stunning an enemy can be anything from the pommel of a dagger to the back of the head, to a kick in the groin, to a deafening thunderclap that disorients the target.
  effect: |
    The target grants TACTICAL ADVANTAGE until the effect ends (enemies gain advantage 1 on their attacks if they do not already have tactical advantage). The afflicted enemy can take only a single action (either move, or normal, or minor) and cannot concentrate to sustain existing boon or bane effects.

  attack:
  - Enchantment vs. Resolve
  invocationTime: 1 Normal Action
  duration: Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)
  description: |
    The stupefied bane has examples in many stories and legends: a vampire’s eyes are rumored to bring a stupor upon their foes, the call of a siren, or the inherent beauty of nymph’s and other woodland creatures. Being stupefied causes the character to be lulled into a sense sense of false security, tranquility, and pacifism.
  effect: |
    The character is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the character’s resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the character has the approximate intelligence of an animal or small child.  If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases, using it’s natural weapons (hands, claws, bite, or in the case of a dragon, breath attack), but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability. If the target sees fire, it will run away, if it feels pain, it will flee.
  special: |
    While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively planning to break free. However, the targets true mind is magically suppressed but fights to regain control.  As such, at the end of each of it’s turns, the target receives a Resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect.  Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional Resist roll to break free from the bane.  Also any action that would startle a wild animal (hit with a rock, slap on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free Resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target’s typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become to immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.

    With supernatural control of the mind, you compel the target to honesty, causing them to be unable to speak falsely
  effect: |
    The target answers any question asked with honesty, to the best of their knowledge. When compelled to reveal something they would not reveal outside of duress, the target makes a Will roll and you make an Enchantment roll. If the target's roll is higher than yours, then they resist the bane and the effect ends.
  special: |
    When you successfully invoke this bane, at the end of it's duration, you can make a normal attack roll to attempt to persist the bane. If successful, the bane persists without requiring the invocation time to be repeated.
    When a target resists the bane, you cannot target them with this bane again for 24 hours.
