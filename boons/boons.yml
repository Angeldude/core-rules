    You are able to supernaturally absorb an object into your body through such means as the mutation or alteration of your body (moving muscles and ligaments aside to make room for it) or by creating an extradimensional space to hide it.
  effect: |
    The object remains in place, completely hidden from the perception of others, until you summon or recall it (automatically) as a minor action. If anything happens to cancel this boon (such as the Dispel bane), the object is immediately shunted out of your body as if you had withdrawn it to your hand.

    You create life or unlife of subhuman intelligence that persists indefinitely and autonomously.
  effect: |
    Your are able to imbue life or unlife into inanimate material components such as dirt, bones, water, vines, or sand (the materials used are subject to GM discretion).  You perform a ritual that last 8 hours. At the end of the ritual, make your action roll. If successful, the inanimate form is imbued with sentience. If you used the Creation attribute to invoke this boon, then it is a normal living creature.  If you used Entropy, then the creature is undead. You can use this boon to animate existing creatures or undead, such as by creating a live wolf from bones and fur or a zombie from an unearthed tomb. However, you cannot use this boon to animate supernatural creatures, such as dragons or basilisks.  Your ability to animate the creature grants no special control or influence over it. Since it was birthed through magic, it has no concept of family, creator, or parent. In the case of aggressive creatures, the GM would handle interaction normally, but there is a strong possibility that the creature would immediately attack its creator.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - You can animate a single creature. Your attribute score must be equal to or greater than the highest attribute score of the creature you’re animating.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - You can animate a group of creatures:  Either 10 creatures with a max attribute of 2, or 5 creatures with a max attribute of 3, or 2 creatures with a max attribute of 5.</li>

You can only maintain one such target at a given time, however concentration is not required to maintain this state, it is perpetuated until you either choose to end it, or you choose to shift your focus.</li>

    Choose a space or object within range. Darkness emanates from the target to a radius equal five feet per power level of the boon. The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the blinded bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc) are unaffected. If the darkness area overlaps an area affected by the Light boon, then the one of greater power level supersedes the other.  If the power level of both is equal, then they cancel each other out.

    You gain supernatural vision that allows you to see colored auras which correlate to magical and spiritual forces.
  effect: |
    When calling on this boon, you must choose from the following: <strong>holy</strong>, <strong>unholy</strong>, <strong>life</strong>, <strong>death</strong>, and <strong>magic</strong>.  You can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming).  These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time after poisoning or killing someone.  Even a Paladin slaying an evil archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing blow.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Holy</strong> - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied. </li>
    <li><strong>Unholy</strong> - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is embodied.</li>
    <li><strong>Life</strong> - Beings from heavenly dimensions, clerics wielding the power of healing, resurrection, or protection radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such powers.</li>
    <li><strong>Death</strong> - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura of death.  For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.</li>
    <li><strong>Magic</strong> - Magical auras surround objects or places imbued with magical effects. Supernatural creatures who are innately magical, such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following use of their power.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Special</strong>: Unlike other boons, this boon can not target another character. Only the character invoking the boon can see the auras.

Attacks against the target have a 50% chance of missing completely, while area attacks still effect the target normally. The target has advantage 1 on attacks against all enemies that can’t see them.

    A target has it’s physical structure altered (temporarily), allowing it to change form to potentially any creature no matter how fantastic or exotic. Common examples of shapeshifting include lyncanthropes (were-creatures like werewolves), dryads, dopplegangers, and certain types of druids.
  effect: |
    You or a willing creature you touch, transform into a creature with a CR equal to or less than your ALTERATION score.  All of your existing Supernatural attribute scores drop to zero. You acquire all the Agility, Fortitude, Might, and Perception attributes of the chosen form.  Initially, shapeshifting targets must be of the same size as the target (you or someone else) and the same power as the character bestowing the boon.  The following limitations apply initially, and are gradually removed at higher power levels:
    <ul>
    <li>You do not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing)</li>
    <li>The new form cannot be a different size than that of the target</li>
    <li>The target does not gain supernatural attributes of the new form (hence, cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature’s Supernatural attributes)</li>
    </ul>
    When shapeshifting, the qualities omitted above are gained as you grow in power with the ALTERATION attribute.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double your size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the target creature.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Shapeshift into another creature between one quarter and quadruple the target creature's starting size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Gain the Flying movement mode of the target creature</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Shapeshift into an unnatural living creature, that lacks a typical physiology; an elemental, or a plant for example.</li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature of any size. </li>
    <li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Gain all Supernatural attributes possessed by the target. </li></ul>
    <strong>Special</strong>: Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a deception action roll which is opposed by perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted. In addition, power level 2 and 4 shapeshifting does not give the shapeshifter mastery of the non-native movement modes of the creature they shift into. So, shapeshifting into a form that allows swimming only works for characters that can already swim or are shapeshifted by power level 6 or higher.
