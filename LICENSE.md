All Open Legend commercial products must be submitted to the authors for editorial review prior to publication. The authors reserve the right to decline to grant the license for reasons including but not limited to: poor presentation, offensive content or poor fit for the Open Legend rules.

The license we are granting is to sell supplementary publications in a digital format at a price determined by the license holder. No fee or royalty will be paid by the licensee to the authors.

The authors make no claim to the copyright of the licensed work except in areas limited by this license. All rights to trademarked terms are retained by the authors.
